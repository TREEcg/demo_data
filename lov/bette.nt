WGS84 geo positioning vocabulary.\n - The saref:DeviceCategory and saref:FunctionCategory classes have been removed. Instead, the hierarchy of device categories has been implemented directly as subclasses of the saref:Device class.\n - The information specific for energy efficiency has been moved to the SAREF4ENER extension. For example, the saref:Profile class has been redefined to accommodate only the properties that are general enough for any type of profile, not only for energy and power. Details on how to specifically model a power profile can be found in the SAREF4ENER extension. \n - The subclasses of the saref:Energy class  have been removed (i.e., Average Energy, Maximum Energy, Minimum Energy, Total Energy, HVAC Energy, Hot Water Energy and Lighting Energy).\n - The saref:Property class has been split into two classes (saref:Property and saref:Measurement), as it is done in the SAREF4ENVI extension, in order to properly accommodate the distinction between the concept of property (an observable quality of something) and the concept of measurement (a concrete value observed for a property).\n - Too restrictive cardinality restrictions have been revised, sometimes making them optional rather than mandatory (better to make properties mandatory in the extensions that specialize SAREF for a specific purpose, rather than restricting SAREF, whose purpose is more general). For example, definitions of units of measurement using an enumeration (owl:oneOf) were too restrictive because they did not allow using other units than those enumerated. Therefore, the individuals of each class are still there, but the owl:oneOf enumeration has been removed.\n - The saref:UnitOfMeasure subclasses use individuals from the OM ontology for unit of measures, but this is not the only solution. It has been clarified in the comments that the OM ontology is an example, but other ontologies can be used.\n - The global restrictions (rdfs:domain and rdfs:range) in object properties have been completely removed not to hinder interoperability. Object properties are now only restricted locally in the classes. \n - The subclasses of saref:Task have been transormed in individuals.\n - The saref:hasTask property has been removed from the saref:Profile class to resolve an ambiguity with the saref:Task class." <https://saref.etsi.org/core/> .

This affects saref:hasDescription, saref:hasManufacturer, saref:hasModel and saref:hasName, which now have implicitly a range of rdfs:Literal.\n - The saref:hasName property has been removed and the use of rdfs:label is recommended. \n - The saref:hasDescription property has been deprecated and the use of rdfs:comment is recommended. \n - Too restrictive restrictions have been removed and in some cases the ontology documentation has been updated to reflect this: a saref:Command having at most one saref:hasDescription; a saref:Task being accomplished by at least one saref:Device; a saref:Device having a typical consumption of only energy or power; a saref:Commodity being measured in units of measure; restrictions on the values of saref:accomplishes that only covered specific use cases; universal restrictions on the saref:actsUpon property have been changed to existential ones; restrictions on the commands that a saref:Function may have, since there could be others not included in the defined enumerations; restrictive documentation of saref:EventFunction and saref:SmokeSensor.\n - Bugs have been fixed: some devices (saref:DoorSwitch, saref:EnergyMeter, saref:LigthSwitch, saref:SmokeSensor, and saref:TemperatureSensor) were defined as subclass of a device and at the same time as consisting of such device; a saref:LightSwitch controls light and does not measure light, since it is an actuator; incorrect documentation of saref:OnState and saref:OffState.\n - The saref:BuildingRelated, saref:EnergyRelated and saref:FunctionRelated classes have been removed, since the different extensions already classify the device types.\n - The instances of the subclasses of saref:Command have been removed, since they represent examples.\n - The instances of saref:UnitOfMeasure have been moved to examples.\n - The classes related to the SAREF4ENER extension have been removed: saref:Generator, saref:Storage, saref:Load and saref:EnergyMeter.\n - Some instances of saref:Device have been moved to examples: saref:WashingMachine, saref:LightingDevice, saref:MicroRenewable, saref:Multimedia, and saref:Network.\n - Added domain and range axioms wherever the definition of a property unambiguously identifies the domain or the range of the property.\n - The OWL Time ontology is not imported anymore.\n - The documentation of some ontology terms has been updated for clarification.\n - Language tags have been added to all labels and comments.\n" <https://saref.etsi.org/core/> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Process> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Processes represents the dynamic class of the perdurants: they are gathered\n            into units, which are contained into ordered timelines bordered by states. Process is\n            the class that bridges to the concept of Process in upper ontologies, externally to\n            Drammar (like DOLCE, where States and Processes are types of Statives: here, we include\n            also the event types called accomplishments and achievements in DOLCE). Consider that\n            such resources are not of linguistic type. The DescriptionTemplate class (or, better,\n            its subclass FrameNetSchema), in fact, drives the behavior of the process inside a Plan\n            or a Unit, linking it (via the ExternalReference Class) to: 1. a Wordnet sense 2. a\n            Frame (from Framenet or Verbnet) 3. a set of Roles, played by roles encompassed in the\n            frame All these links are bridged by the ExternalReference Class, which has\n            \"quale\" properties that link the reference to specific resources. In the\n            external ontology, a process may be logically defined through the use of axioms: for\n            example, in the action of asking, it is assumed that Speaker and Addressee are connected\n            through some communication medium, e.g. co-presence in a room or a telephone. In\n            Drammar, the DramaStructures that contain the Processes are Units (subclasses of\n            DramaSets) and Plans (subclasses of DramaLists). They are then subdivided through a\n            further trait, that is whether the process is intentional (of an agent) or not (Action\n            or UnintentionalProcess). This trait is defined through a specific Datatype property, of\n            boolean type, called isIntentional. So, its subclasses are: - Action: with isIntentional\n            property valued TRUE; - UnintentionalProcess: with isIntentional property valued FALSE.\n            Same happens in parallel to the States, although in that case the trait concerns the\n            state schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#SituationSchema> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The situation schema provides the pattern for the description of incidents and states. It is inspired by the Situation ontology Pattern of the Ontology Design Pattern initiative (http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/). So, a SituationSchema describes (\"describes\" object property) a DramaPerdurant (either a State or a Process).\nThe schema works as a hub for the roles involved in a situation. The property hasRole links the Situation class (its domain) with the Role class (the range of the property). Also, notice that, as illustrated in the documentation of the SituationSchema class, a Situation Schema (or, better, its subclasses) does not directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge employed to describe drama: rather, it refers to the ExternalRefSchema class (subclass of the top level ExternalReference class), which in  turn refers to the linguistic knowledge. The SituationSchema class specializes into specific schemata for describing specific type of situations: \n- FrameNetSchema: for describing processes, like giving or killing (in Drammar, they are grouped into units arranged on timelines), and states, like being behind some object or being dead (in Drammar, they are bundled into sets that border timelines and plans). \n- MentalStateSchema: this class groups the specific types of schemata for describing the mental states of the agents in Drammar, namely beliefs, goals, emotions and values. \nTechnically, the subtypes of SituationSchema are characterized by different values of the quale_schemaType data property: \"belief\", \"emotion\", \"framenet\", \"goal\",  \"value\". \nFinally, it is worth mentioning that is a specific design choice of Drammar not to represent the nesting of states: only the type of the top level state, e.g., a belief, is represented, independent of what that belief contains in turn. This flat style of representation is determined by the decision not to commit to a specific logical account of state types. When Drammar is employed for annotation, the content nested into a state is described informally in natural language description accompanying the state, if needed. \nRefs: Gangemi, A., & Presutti, V.

An SituationSchema (or, better, a subclass of\n            it) can be linked to its ExternalRefSchema by the hasExtRef object property, which has\n            the ExternalReference as its range.
