This means that the first property will always have the same value as the second. Cases where this relation can be used are if an object's geometry is modelled RDF-based and contains a property defining e.g. the height of the object. Then the non-geometric property for height should be explicitly derived from the geometric property to ensure data integrity."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
