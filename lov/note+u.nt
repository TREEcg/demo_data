<http://purl.org/spar/fabio/Quotation> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "A quotation is a repetition of what someone has said, and is presented \"within quotation marks\", for example:\n\nOn June 4th 1940, Winston Churchill made a speech on the radio that has since become famous, that included the words:\n       \" . . . we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender . . .\"\n\nSimilarly, the words \"but Brutus is an honourable man\" from Mark Antony's funeral speech in Shakespeare's play Julius Caesar is a quotation, since Mark Antony says these words in the play."@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
