If we consider metrology, the value of a physical quality Q is expressed as the product of a numerical value {Q} and a physical unit [Q]: Q = {Q} x [Q]. In MUO, the class muo:QualityValue is used to represent the values of qualities, Q. Instances of this class are related with 1) exactly one unit, suitable for measure the physical quality (meters for length, grams for weight, etc), by means of the property muo:measuredIn, [Q]; 2) a number, which express the relationship between the value and the unit by means of the rdf:value property, {Q}; 3) a time, which expresses the quality value along the line of time. Quality values can be temporalized, but this is not always necessary.\n"@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .
