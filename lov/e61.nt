It does not convey any other meaning than a positioning on the \"time-line\" of chronology. The Time-Span in turn is approximated by a set of dates (E61 Time Primitive). A temporal entity can have in reality only one Time-Span, but there may exist alternative opinions about it, which we would express by assigning multiple Time-Spans. Related temporal entities may share a Time-Span. Time-Spans may have completely unknown dates but other descriptions by which we can infer knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) has time-span Yalta Conference time-span (E52)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP4(x,y) ⊃ E2(x)\nP4(x,y) ⊃ E52(y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
