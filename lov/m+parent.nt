The hierarchy of the referenced map is merged into the container map at the position of the reference, and the relationship tables of the child map are added to the parent map."@en-US <http://purl.org/dita/ns#> .

<https://w3id.org/GConsent#MinorDataSubject> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Minor is a Data Subject who cannot provide their own consent (that is legally valid). Therefore, their consent must be obtained via a Guardian or Legal Representative or Parent. Minor is a subclass of Data Subject.\n\nConsent given in lieu of a Minor (by their Representative) is associated with the `ConsentInstance` class/instance using the `wasGivenBy` property.\n\nThe ontology currently does not capture this relationship between the Minor and their Representative. This is due to required clarifications regarding how this role should be represented. For example, the `DataSubject` cannot be subclassed to create a `Representative` class, as this would make the `DataSubject` a permanent representative for the Minor. Instead, the role of 'acting as representative' is only for the instance of the given consent. Therefore, this could be represented with a `ConsentRepresentativeRole` class that links to the `MinorDataSubject` with `roleHadDataSubject` property, and the `DataSubject` that gave the consent via the `roleHadRepresentative` property. The relationship or reason or situation of this given consent can be captured by further annotating the `ConsentRepresentativeRole` instance. This approach can also be extended to other similar situations where one `DataSubject` gives consent in lieu of another.\n\nNote: A Minor can provide their own consent in certain cases, or conversely, a minor's consent may need to be provided by a 'parental' representative in some cases."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
