<http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property#atmosphere_moles_of_clox_expressed_as_chlorine> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> " The construction \"atmosphere_moles_of_X\" means the total number of moles of X in the entire atmosphere, i.e. summed over the atmospheric column and over the entire globe. \"Clox\" describes a family of chemical species consisting of inorganic chlorine compounds with the exception of  hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). \"Clox\" is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. \"Inorganic chlorine\", sometimes referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other aerosols.   Standard names that use the term \"inorganic_chlorine\" are used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase 'expressed_as' is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .

The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. The chemical formula for butane is C4H10. Butane is a member of the group of hydrocarbons known as alkanes.  There are standard names for the alkane group as well as for some of the individual species." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .
