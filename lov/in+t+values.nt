Values in the enumeration list follow a standard international code where the first letter describes how the primary windings are connected, the second letter describes how the secondary windings are connected, and the numbers describe the rotation of voltages and currents from the primary to the secondary side in multiples of 30 degrees. D: means that the windings are delta-connected. Y: means that the windings are star-connected. Z: means that the windings are zig-zag connected (a special start-connected providing low reactance of the transformer). The connectivity is only relevant for three-phase transformers."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .

For example the elementary charge e is a natural unit of electric charge, or the speed of light c is a natural unit of speed.</p>\r\n<p>A purely natural system of units is defined in such a way that some set of selected universal physical constants are normalized to unity; that is, their numerical values in terms of these units become exactly 1.</p>\r\n<p>Examples are Planck Units and Atomic Units. Atomic units (au or a.u.) form a system of natural units which is especially convenient for atomic physics calculations. There are two different kinds of atomic units, which one might name Hartree atomic units and Rydberg atomic units, which differ in the choice of the unit of mass and charge.</p>\r\n<p>Planck units are unique among systems of natural units, because they are not defined in terms of properties of any prototype, physical object, or even elementary particle.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
