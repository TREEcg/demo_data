For example,  Power is a property and Watt is a unit of power that represents a definite predetermined power: when we say 10 Watt, we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined power called \\\"watt\\\". Our definition is based on the definition of unit of measure in the Ontology of units of Measure (OM). We propose here a list of some units of measure that are relevant for the purpose of SAREF, but this list can be extended, also using some other ontologies rather than the Ontology of units of Measure (OM)."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4wear/> .

A command may act upon a state, but does not necessarily act upon a state. For example, the ON command acts upon the ON/OFF state, but the GET command does not act upon any state, it simply gives a directive to retrieve a certain value.
