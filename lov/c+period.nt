Inspired by the first element of the structured value of the REQUEST-STATUS property described in RFC 2445 sec. 4.8.8.2.\n\nThe short return status is a PERIOD character (US-ASCII decimal 46) separated 3-tuple of integers. For example, \"3.1.1\". The successive  levels of integers provide for a successive level of status code granularity.\n\nThe following are initial classes for the return status code. Individual iCalendar object methods will define specific return status codes for these classes. In addition, other classes for the return status code may be defined using the registration process defined later in this memo.\n\n 1.xx - Preliminary success. This class of status of status code indicates that the request has request has been initially processed but that completion is pending.\n\n2.xx -Successful. This class of status code indicates that the request was completed successfuly. However, the exact status code can indicate that a fallback has been taken.\n\n3.xx - Client Error. This class of status code indicates that the request was not successful. The error is the result of either a syntax or a semantic error in the client formatted request. Request should not be retried until the condition in the request is corrected.\n\n4.xx - Scheduling Error. This class of status code indicates that the request was not successful. Some sort of error occurred within the  calendaring and scheduling service, not directly related to the request itself." <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/04/02/ncal> .
