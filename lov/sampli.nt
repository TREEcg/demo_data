Stub classes are provided for time, geometry and measure (scaled number), which can be substituted at run-time by a suitable concrete representation of the concept. \r\nThe model for Specimen has a dependency on W3C PROV-O. Specimen is modelled as a subclass of prov:Entity, so PROV can be used to describe specimen preparation chains. " <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/sam-lite> .

Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.\n\nThis classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually less time-dependent than the property value." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/sam-lite> .
