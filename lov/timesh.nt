The communicator decided when a concrete work was broadcasted and the consumers had just to the option to get or not access to the communication medium in order to consume the content. Consumers did not have any alternative to time-shift content consumption without the intervention of recording mediums.\nHowever, communication mediums that allow user interaction have appeared, among which the Internet is the more important one nowadays.

This kind of communication is called to MakeAvailable in the copyright context."@en <http://rhizomik.net/ontologies/copyrightonto.owl> .
