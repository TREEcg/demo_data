Politiquement, le marxisme repose sur la participation au mouvement réel de la lutte des classes, afin d'arriver à une société sans classes en tant qu'alternative au capitalisme. En effet, Karl Marx considère que «l'émancipation des travailleurs doit être l'œuvre des travailleurs eux-mêmes».» <a href=\"#cwrc:727d97bc-af78-4122-94be-aa78b2e97d5a\">(DBpedia, 2017)</a>"@fr <http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontologies/cwrc> .

<http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontologies/cwrc#marxism> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition> "\"Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Marxist methodology originally used a method of economic and sociopolitical inquiry known as historical materialism to analyze and critique the development of capitalism and the role of class struggle in systemic economic change. According to Marxist perspective, class conflict within capitalism arises due to intensifying contradictions between the highly productive mechanized and socialized production performed by the proletariat, and the private ownership and appropriation of the surplus product (profit) by a small minority of the population who are private owners called the bourgeoisie. As the contradiction becomes apparent to the proletariat through the alienation of labor, social unrest between the two antagonistic classes will intensify, until it culminates in social revolution. The eventual long-term outcome of this revolution would be the establishment of socialism – a socioeconomic system based on social ownership of the means of production, distribution based on one's contribution, and production organized directly for use. As the productive forces and technology continued to advance, Marx hypothesized that socialism would eventually give way to a communist stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\". Marxism has since developed into different branches and schools of thought, and there is now no single definitive Marxist theory. Different Marxian schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of classical Marxism while de-emphasising or rejecting other aspects, and sometimes combine Marxist analysis with non-Marxian concepts; as a result, they might reach contradictory conclusions from each other. Lately, however, there is movement towards the recognition that the main aspect of Marxism is philosophy of dialectical materialism and historicism, which should result to more agreement between different schools. Marxist analyses and methodologies have influenced multiple political ideologies and social movements, and Marxist understandings of history and society have been adopted by some academics in the disciplines of archaeology, anthropology, media studies, political science, theater, history, sociology, art history and theory, cultural studies, education, economics, geography, literary criticism, aesthetics, critical psychology, and philosophy.\" <a href=\"#cwrc:727d97bc-af78-4122-94be-aa78b2e97d5a\">(DBpedia, 2017)</a>"@en <http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontologies/cwrc> .
