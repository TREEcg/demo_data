In digital applications it's usually referred to as \"576i\", in analogue contexts it's often quoted as \"625 lines\". The 576 identifies a vertical resolution of 576 lines (usually with a horizontal resolution of 720 or 704 pixels), and the i identifies it as an interlaced resolution.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"576ii\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576i) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .
