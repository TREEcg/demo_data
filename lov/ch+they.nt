<http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite#ObservationContext> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Some observations depend on other observations to provide context which is important, sometimes essential, in understanding the result. These dependencies are stronger than mere spatio-temporal coincidences, requiring explicit representation. If present, the association class class ObservationContext (Figure 2) shall link a OM_Observation to another OM_Observation, with the role name relatedObservation for the target. It shall support one attribute.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\tSome examples include the conditions associated with experimental replicates (e.g., experimental plots and treatments used), biotic factors (e.g., ecological community), interactions among features (e.g., predator-prey), or other temporary relationships occurring at the time of observation that are are not inherent to the observed features themselves (i.e., they change over time), or the related observation may provide input to a process that generates a new result.\r\nThis association complements the Intention association which describes relationships between a sampling feature and domain features." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite> .
