The Semantic Actuator Network Ontology (SAN) proposes that ssn:Property be a subClass of qudt:QuantityKind. Yet a property may be not measureable and numerically quantifiable. Indeed, it may also be a boolean, or any other kind of quality value (e.g., \"UNOPERATED\")."@en <https://w3id.org/seas/QUDTAlignment> .
