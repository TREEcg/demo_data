However, it is possible to stick to FRBR and bypass the worflow\nmechanism this ontology defines by using the core FRBR properties on such objects. But it is often better to use events to interconnect such \nexpressions (allowing to go deeply into the production process - `this performer was playing this particular instrument at that\nparticular time').\n    \n    " <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .

A single event may be described by several programmes, for example one may give a break down by day, another by rooms, another by topic.\n\nA programme should not have Timeslots or Events if it subprogrammes. In effect this means there are two subclasses of Programme, but there's no need to express that in the data.\n\nA simple application only needs to operate on a single Programme at once." <http://purl.org/prog/> .
