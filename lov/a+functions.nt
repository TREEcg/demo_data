It is an output from an execution of a data mining algorithm implementation. Models have a dual nature. They can be treated as data structures and as such represented, stored and manipulated. On the other hand, they act as functions and are executed, taking as input data examples and giving as output the result of applying the function to a data example. Models can also be divided into global or local ones. A global model has global coverage of a data set, i.e., it generalizes the whole data set. A local model, such as a pattern set, is a set of local hypotheses, i.e. each applies to a limited region of the data set." <http://www.w3.org/ns/mls> .
