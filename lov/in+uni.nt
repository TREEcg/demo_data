<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DramaPerdurant> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The DramaPerdurant class contains the entities of drama that can described as\n            perdurants in DOLCE (Gangemi et al. 2002): \"Perdurants [...] just extend in time by\n            accumulating different temporal parts, so that, at any time they are present, they are\n            only partially present, in the sense that some of their proper temporal parts (e.g.,\n            their previous or future phases) may be not present.\" In other words, perdurants,\n            namaly processes, are not entirely present at any time they are present, differently\n            from endurants. The DramaEdurant is the class of elements of Drama that describe the\n            story dynamics, i.e. Processes and States. In the context of Drammar, the individuals of\n            this class describe the story advancement in terms of incidents and states holding\n            between incidents. Each has a specific relation to the segmentation of drama: processes\n            are grouped in units, states precedes and follows timelines (which contain units).\n            Notice that processes and states are not distinct in Framenet, the knowledge source we\n            refer to for describing perdurants outside of Drammar.
