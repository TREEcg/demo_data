<http://www.purl.org/drammar#SetMember> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Class of the elements\n            of the sets (sets are conflict sets, consistent state sets, and units). Sometimes\n            referred to as SM. The hasMember object property has the Set class as its domain and the\n            SetMember as its range. Notice that this class works as a placeholder that represents\n            the single element in a set (it is not the content itself): the property hasData links\n            the SetMember with the actual data, i.e. the content of the item. For example, the\n            specific Set that is a Unit hasMember some SetMember that hasData some\n            Action." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
