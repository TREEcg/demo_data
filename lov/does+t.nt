<http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/examples/2> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "<p>\n\n      The relationship vocabulary can be used to describe relationships with the people linked from a web page. This is particularly useful for blogrolls or contact lists but can be used with any type of link. The HTML <code>a</code> element provides two attributes, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rel\">rel and rev</a>, that can be used to specify the relationship. Both <code>rel</code> and <code>rev</code> take a space separated list of keywords as their value. To use a term from the relationship vocabulary just drop the <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> namespace to leave the property name, e.g. <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/worksWith</code> would become <code>worksWith</code> which can be added as the value of <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code>.\n    </p>\n    <dl>\n      <dt>\n        <code>rel</code>\n      </dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>\n          The <code>rel</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linked</em> page has with the author of the <em>linking</em> page.\n          For example:\n        </p>\n        <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rel</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n        <p>This link states that the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code> is a child of the author of the html above. </p>\n      </dd>\n      <dt>\n        <code>rev</code>\n      </dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>\n          The <code>rev</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linking</em> page has with the author of the   <em>linked</em> page. The example here is:\n        </p>\n        <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rev</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n        <p>In this case the meaning of the link is reversed: the author of the html above is a child of the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code>.</p>\n      </dd>\n    </dl>\n    <p>The HTML and XHTML recommendations require an HTML document to declare a custom profile if it uses any non-standard <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code> types. This is done by adding a <code>profile</code> attribute with a value of <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> to the document's <code>head</code> element. </p>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;head profile=\"http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>\n    <h3>Complete Example</h3>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;html profile=\"http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/\"&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Here are the people I know:&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~freddy\" rel=\"closeFriendOf\"&gt;Freddy (he's cool!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://frooble.com/\" rel=\"mentorOf\"&gt;Jimbo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mmmm.com/klm\" rel=\"friendOf\"&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~omah\" rel=\"worksWith\"&gt;Omah (does the coding)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~jason\" rev=\"closeFriendOf employedBy\"&gt;Jason, my henchman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n    <h3>RDF Interpretation</h3>\n    <p>Custom parsers that extract RDF from (X)HTML can use the relationships expressed in the links to infer the\n  equivilent RDF triples. It should be remembered that the relationship is between the authors of the pages not between\n  the pages themselves. Given the following link on a document at <code>http://example.com/mypage.html</code>:\n  </p>\n    <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rel</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n    <p>a suggested RDF extraction is:</p>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;foaf:Person&gt;\n    &lt;foaf:maker rdf:resource=\"http://example.com/boats\"/&gt;\n    &lt;rel:childOf&gt;\n      &lt;foaf:Person&gt;\n        &lt;foaf:maker rdf:resource=\"http://example.com/mypage.html\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;\n    &lt;/rel:childOf&gt;\n  &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;</code></pre>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral> <http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/> .

<http://caressesrobot.org/ontology> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:\n\n- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?\n- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? \n- Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?\n- Topics of conversation.  Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?\n\nThe CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:\n\n- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner\n- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.\n- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted person’s preferences and needs.\n\nPlease refer to the following for additional information:\n- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;\n- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.

A Role is filled by a\n            DramaEntity: the fact that a given role has an entity as a filler is represented by the\n            hasFiller property and its inverse isFillerOf property. A Role belongs (isRoleOf) to a\n            given SituationSchema, namely a ProcessSchema or a StateSchema (hasRole property). The\n            Role class is related to its filler by the hasFiller property, whose range is the\n            DramaEntity class. For example, given the incident describable as \"Ophelia gives\n            the gift back to Hamlet\", the roles of \"donor\" (the one who does the\n            action of giving), \"recipient\" (the one wjho receives the object to be given)\n            and \"theme\" (the object of giving action) are all instance of the Role class\n            connected to the same Situation, each labeled with a linguistic label\n            (\"donor\", \"recipient\", etc.) and each connected to its filler via\n            the hasFiller property. Roles can also be intended as thematic roles of verbs following\n            the description contained in the Verbnet resource\n            (http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/index.php). The Role class, via the hasExtRef\n            object property, is linked to the subclass of the top level ExternalReference class, the\n            ExternalRefRole class, whose function is to connect the description of the role with the\n            appropriate role name or URI in a linguistic account of roles through apposite data\n            properties (namely, the Role_framenetRoleID and Role_verbnetRoleType data properties\n            respectively for FrameNet and VerbNet)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
