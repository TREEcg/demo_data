The individuals are bridge individuals to some external formal OCC-based\n            knowledge source, which does not exist yet but is assumed here. These individuals could\n            also be a bridge to some commonsense ontology, such as YagoSumo for Values, but it would\n            be different from the adoption of the OCC theory, as committed in\n            Drammar." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
