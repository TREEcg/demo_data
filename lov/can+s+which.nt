<https://w3id.org/skgo/modsci#TypeTheory> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In mathematics, logic, and computer science, a type theory is any of a class of formal systems, some of which can serve as alternatives to set theory as a foundation for all mathematics. In type theory, every \"term\" has a \"type\" and operations are restricted to terms of a certain type." <https://w3id.org/skgo/modsci#> .

<https://w3id.org/skgo/modsci#ComputerConcurrency> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems." <https://w3id.org/skgo/modsci#> .
