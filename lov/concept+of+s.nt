<http://www.purl.org/drammar#State> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "State represents the static class of the Perdurant. State is the class that\n            bridges to the concept of State in upper ontologies, externally to Drammar. For example,\n            in DOLCE, states and process are the two distinct types of statives. Both factual and\n            eventive states are further divided into different state types: - MentalStates, namely\n            Belief, Goals, Values and Emotions (all sharing some propositional content in their\n            description); - StateOfAffairs, namely situations holding in the world. States participate\n            to some structure. In Drammar, these structures are ConsistenStateSets (types of Sets),\n            which borders timelines and plans. The specific type pf States are defined through the\n            use of specific types of StateSchema (subclass of DescriptionTemplate). So, its\n            subclasses are: - MentalState: the mental state of an agent; - StateOfAffairs: an\n            objective state of the story world." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<https://w3id.org/pep/Process> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The description of a process. A process generalizes the concept of `ssn:Sensing` in the SSN ontology, and of `san:Acting` in the SAN ontology. Examples of processes include sensing, acting, planning, or forecasting.\n\nIn the first version of the SSN ontology, `ssn:Process` was a subclass of `dul:Method`.\n\nA `dul:Method` is a Description that defines or uses concepts in order to guide carrying out actions aimed at a solution with respect to a problem. It is different from a Plan, because plans could be carried out in order to follow a method, but a method can be followed by executing alternative plans."@en <https://w3id.org/pep/> .
