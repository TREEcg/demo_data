It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc. In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.\nA digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of the manuscript page\nIt is an implicit transitive property.\n\nExamples:\t\n\n- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) P165 incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E38) P165 incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E38) P165 incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E73(x)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E90(y)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ P106(x,y)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
