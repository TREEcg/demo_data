The O&M ontology (ISO 19156) defines Time Series Observation  as an “observation whose result is a time-series”, while both Hl7 aECG and DICOM standards define the Series element as a sequence of data sharing a common frame of reference. In SAREF4health this concept is termed as Time Series Measurements since this sequence of data refers to time series measured by a health device."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4ehaw/> .
