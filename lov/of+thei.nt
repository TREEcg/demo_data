The physical characteristics of the features themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.\n\nEXAMPLE A “station” is essentially an identifiable locality where a sensor system or procedure may be deployed and an observation made. In the context of the observation model, it connotes the “world in the vicinity of the station”, so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artefact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc.\n\nNOTE A transient sampling feature, such as a ships-track or flight-line, might be identified and described, but is unlikely to be revisited exactly.\n\nA sampling feature is intended to sample some feature-of-interest in an application domain. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19156/2011/sampling> .

This can happen, for instance, if the user is allowed to begin the configuration process by choosing features without any control of their compatibility; or if she is allowed to choose a feature incompatible with her previous selections. In this case, it is the responsibility of the configurator application to restore the consistency of the configuration, necessarily by excluding some of the previous user selections. This Configuration class excludes such invalid combinations. \n\nRelation with GoodRelations and schema.org vocabularies :\nbecause a configuration mainly describes a Partially Defined Product, it can be seen as a GoodRelations \"ProductOrServiceModel\" (or a schema.org \"ProductModel): \"an intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced products, in the sense of a prototype\". The suffix \"Model\" may seem misleading when used for a Configuration, as it suggests something such as \"Ford T\", and not \"Ford T with sunroof and climat control (itself not a completely defined product -  you still can choose, well, the color: it is a \"prototype of similar products\").\n\nOn the other hand, a Configuration has a price (more precisely, a \"from price\" - the minimum of the \"suggested retail prices\" of all the matching completely defined products). As such, a Configuration may be seen as a commercial offer. It can also be used to represent a customer's wish list, constrained by the definition of the range. It could therefore be considered as a gr:Offering (or a schema:Offer) as well.\n\nBut gr:ProductOrService and gr:Offering are disjoint classes: a given Configuration cannot be both. Depending on the use case, a publisher of configuration data may want to type her Configurations with either of these classes."@en <http://purl.org/configurationontology> .

The decision that a situation is characteristic of an extended period of time is not in itself linguistic, but once it has been made, an explicitly habitual form can be used to describe it. Note that the classification of a situation as characteristic of a period of time is not derived directly from the comparison of their length or frequency; hence, the situation may be objectively either long or short, and either frequent or infrequent, with respect to the period it characterises. This is because the way we choose to characterise can involve a component which is objectively small in relation to the whole.\nTypically, for an aspect value to be labelled as Habitual, the aspectual meaning has to minimally express habituality, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings, or actionality distinctions. Habituality can in principle be combined with any other semantic aspectual values appropriate to situations that can be protracted in time or iterated [Comrie 1976: 26-32]. Since habituality is concerned with the internal temporal structure of the (extended) event, it can be regarded as a sub-type of imperfectivity.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.

Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the orientation of their planar normals. If all the patches are in alignment (their normals are parallel), then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be represented as a single patch if it is connected.\nThe boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to its exterior and interior boundaries.\nA Polygon is a simple Surface that is planar.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names. \n\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci\n- Stonehenge\n- the hole in the ozone layer\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics\n- the Bermuda Triangle\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE77(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The term 'line' is used when a culture has undergone an intentional experimental process to establish a more uniform and stable population of cells (see 'establishing cell line'). This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, 'lines' are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time. A *new* cell line can be \"established\" not only through the passaging/selection of a primary culture, but also through experimental modifications of existing lines (e.g. immortalization, stable genetic modifications, drug selection for a resistant subset, etc.).  As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quescent state for future use. \n\n2. The definitional criteria provided here for the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.?\n\n3. Definitinal criteria are intended to be sufficiently clear to specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world. A 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this common history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to the collection of all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as cells in these collections will likely not all share a common culture history. Rather, 'HeLa cell line' could refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).  As noted above, it is such collections that are typically referred to in scientific discourse and publications.\n\n4. Notably, the term 'line' has been alternately used by other terminologies and communities to refer to cultures that have been immortalized - ie has attained the capacity for indefinite propagation in vitro.  In this ontology, we refer to such cell lines as 'immortal cell lines', and use the term 'cell line' to indicate any culture that has been passaged." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Subclass axioms were: 'has grain' some 'cell line cell' and 'has grain' only 'cell line cell'\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: There is considerable ambiguity and inconsistent usage surrounding the term 'cell line' across biomedical communities. For exmaple, it can refer to the maximal collection of all cells in a cultured lineage (e.g. the colelction of all HeLa cells that exist), or to discrete portions of this maximal collection that are stored, exchanged, and applied experimentally (e.g. the dish of HeLa cells I am using in my experiment). A working group of representatives from OBI, CLO, and CL was assembled in spring of 2013 to harmonize modeling and terminology surrounding experimentally cultured cells across Open Biomedical Ontologies, following OBO Foundry principles of orthogonality and re-use. A consensus was reached to apply the term 'cell line' to refer not to a maximal collection of cells of a given type, but to discrete populations of cultured cells that share a common propagation history which has conferred a certain a genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to the population.  This meaning reflects its most common usage in domain discourse, and will best support data annotation requirements. This view means that a 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this specific history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to collections such as all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as all cells in these collections do not necessarily share a common culture history. Rather, it could be used to refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).\n\nThis approach seems to accomplish several desirable goals:\n1) It allows us to define the term 'cell line' for the community in a precise way that also reflects how the term is most commonly used in the literature and scientific discourse.\n(2) It gives a definition that provides clear criteria to help specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world\n(3) The criteria it provides demarcate populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.\n(4) The definition seems to be true to the meaning of the word 'line' - which is suggests a specific lineage of derivation." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

The code lists are published separately at http://reference.data.gov.au/def/ont/iso19160-1-address/codelist.\n\nAdditionally, this version adds some metadata, such as this explanation, some further annotation properties to better display elements of the ontology and includes a human-readable (HTML) version of the ontology generated from the RDF version.\n\nAs the GOM's version of the ontology evolves, we will keep this version up-to-date as we intend to only publish an easier-to-access version of their ontology here, not to profile it."@en <http://reference.data.gov.au/def/ont/iso19160-1-address> .
