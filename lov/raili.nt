It can be distinguished from other types of construction components since they are, in normal situations, no individual components. An example are the steps and railings as sub components of a stairs component. Use a more specific subclass from a dedicated taxonomy such as BEO based on IFC or AAT-ARCH based on the Getty AAT concepts related to constructions."@en <https://w3id.org/con-tax> .
