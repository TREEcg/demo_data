Gold open access has the benefit that the article is findable where you expect it to be, but licensing restrictions may limit the possibilities for downloading, text mining, modification, re-publication or re-use of the published work.

There are a wide variety of ways in which such strings can be presented. One finds the following:</p>\n<pre>\n  e1 dc d5 e1 00 8f 21 5e d5 cc 7c 7e c4 9c ad 86 \n  64 aa dc 29 f2 8d d9 56 7f 31 b6 bd 1b fd b8 ee \n  51 0d 3c 84 59 a2 45 d2 13 59 2a 14 82 1a 0f 6e \n  d3 d1 4a 2d a9 4c 7e db 90 07 fc f1 8d a3 8e 38 \n  25 21 0a 32 c1 95 31 3c ba 56 cc 17 45 87 e1 eb \n  fd 9f 0f 82 16 67 9f 67 fa 91 e4 0d 55 4e 52 c0 \n  66 64 2f fe 98 8f ae f8 96 21 5e ea 38 9e 5c 4f \n  27 e2 48 ca ca f2 90 23 ad 99 4b cc 38 32 6d bf  \n</pre>\n<p>\n Or the same as the above, with ':' instead of spaces. We can't guarantee that these are the only ways such tools will present hexadecimals, so we are very lax.</p>\n <p>The letters can be uppercase or lowercase, or mixed.  </p>\n <p>Some strings may start with initial 00's, and can be stripped in this notation as they often are. Doing this could, in complement of 2 notation turn a positive number into a negative one, if the first hexadecimal character happens to be one of  the set {'8', '9', 'a', 'A', 'b', 'B', 'c', 'C', 'd', 'D', 'e', 'E', 'f', 'F'} .  As we interpret this string as a hexadecimal number leading 00s are not important  (Complement of 2 notation and hexadecimal overlap for positive numbers)</p>\n<p> In order to make this fun, we allow any unicode characters in the string. A parser should </p>\n  <ol>\n<li>remove all non hexadecimal characters</li>\n<li>treat the resulting as a hexadecimal representation of a number</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n This will allow people to make an ascii - better yet a UTF-8 - picture of their public key when publishing it on the web.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Cert hex is also a datatype property because we used to write it out like this\n</p>\n <pre>\n   [] a rsa:RSAPublicKey;\n     rsa:public_exponent [ cert:hex \"e1 dc d5 ...\"] \n </pre> \n<p> The above notation is now deprecated.
