Every Step has an Action to be performed and a Transition to another Step to be performed after completing the execution of the Action. \nWith Steps is possible to establish an order for the execution of Actions, as each Step has a Transition that sets the Step of origin and destination. Once a CompoundAction has an initial Step (IPO: hasFirstStep), from this Step can be run all other steps that composes the compoundAction following the Transition between them."@en <http://purl.org/ipo/core> .
