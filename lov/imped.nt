<http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1#RF> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An RF connector is an electrical connector designed to work at radio frequencies in the multi-megahertz range. RF connectors are typically used with coaxial cables and are designed to maintain the shielding that the coaxial design offers. Better models also minimize the change in transmission line impedance at the connection. Mechanically they provide a fastening mechanism (thread, bayonet, braces, push pull) and springs for a low ohmic electric contact while sparing the gold surface thus allowing above 1000 reconnects and reducing the insertion force. Research activity in the area of radio-frequency (RF) circuit design has surged in the last decade in direct response to the enormous market demand for inexpensive, high data rate wireless transceivers.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"RF connector\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_connector) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .

<http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1#DigitalAudioCoaxialOut> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Digital audio uses digital signals for sound reproduction. This includes analog-to-digital conversion, digital-to-analog conversion, storage and transmission. From the signal point of view, a connector can be viewed as a short, rigid cable. The connector usually has the same impedance as the related cable and probably has a similar cutoff frequency although its dielectric may be different. Some connectors are gold or rhodium plated, while some connectors use nickel or tin plating. Silver is also used due to its excellent conductivity. Although silver tends to oxidize rather quickly, the silver oxide that is produced is still conductive. This may pose a cosmetic issue but it does not degrade the performance of the connector. Here the output is meant.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"Digital audio\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .
