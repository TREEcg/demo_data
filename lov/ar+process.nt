ISO defines them in three separate standards. However, their interaction has been poorly studied, so far. The SQuAP model (Software Quality, Architecture, Process) describes twenty-eight main factors that impact on software quality in banking systems, and each factor is described as a relation among some characteristics from the three ISO standards. Hence, SQuAP makes such relations emerge rigorously, although informally. SQaAP-Ont is an OWL ontology that formalises those relations in order to represent and reason via Linked Data about software engineering in a three-dimensional model consisting of quality, architecture, and process characteristics." <https://w3id.org/squap/> .

State is the class that\n            bridges to the concept of State in upper ontologies, externally to Drammar. For example,\n            in DOLCE, states and process are the two distinct types of statives. Both factual and\n            eventive states are further divided into different state types: - MentalStates, namely\n            Belief, Goals, Values and Emotions (all sharing some propositional content in their\n            description); - StateOfAffairs, namely situations holding in the world. States participate\n            to some structure. In Drammar, these structures are ConsistenStateSets (types of Sets),\n            which borders timelines and plans. The specific type pf States are defined through the\n            use of specific types of StateSchema (subclass of DescriptionTemplate). So, its\n            subclasses are: - MentalState: the mental state of an agent; - StateOfAffairs: an\n            objective state of the story world." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
