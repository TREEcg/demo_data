Luminous flux is measured either for the interior as a whole or for a part of the interior (partial luminous flux for a solid angle). All other photometric parameters are derivatives of luminous flux. Luminous flux is measured in lumens (lm). The luminous flux is given as a nominal value for each lamp. Usually measured in Lumen (lm, Candela Steradian)."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
