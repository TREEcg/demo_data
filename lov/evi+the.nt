<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/AssumptiveEvidentiality> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "One of the three types of judgment common in languages, that indicates inference from what is generally known. English has the contrast between Deductive and Assumptive, as shown in: 'John must be in his office', 'John'll be in his office'. Schlichter comments that the speaker believes the case to be true…in the case of the Assumptive ‘because of his experience with similar situations, regular patterns, or repeated circumstances common in human life’. It is used when the speaker has prior knowledge about the state of things or about habitual or general 'behavior patterns', but 'only when no information about the state or event is being or has been received'. In that sense it is the negative member of the evidential system, used when no ready evidence is available. [Palmer 2001: 24-25; 30; 51]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
