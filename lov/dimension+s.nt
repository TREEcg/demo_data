Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.\nDimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.\nEven though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.\n\nExamples:\n- 31 August 1997 measurement of height of silver cup 232 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54) has unit mm (E58), has value 224 (E60)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP40(x,y) ⊃ E16(x)\nP40(x,y)⊃ E54(y)\nP40(x,y) ⊃ P141(x,y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/muo#SimpleDerivedUnit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Units that are derived from exactly one base unit. There are two main possibilities. On one hand, there are units that are derived by adding a prefix to the unit. The prefix is a name or associated symbol (e.g. kilo) that precedes a unit of measure (e.g. meter) to form a decimal multiple or submultiple (e.g. Kilometer). Derived units, obtained by the application of a prefix, measure the same physical quality as its base unit. On the other hand, there are another kind of simple derived units that are also obtained from exactly one base unit but they measure a different physical quality. They are obtained by changing the exponent of the unit in the dimensional equation. For instance, this is how square meters are derived from meters. This exponent is represented in MUO with the datatype property muo:dimensionalSize. Combining this two patterns we can represent units that are obtained from a prefix and that have a dimension size different from 1, for instance, the unit square kilometer."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .
