It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient.

The interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.\n\nExamples:\n- the collection of a hammer-head shark of the genus Sphyrna (Carchariniformes) XXXtbc by John Steinbeck and Edward Ricketts at Puerto Escondido in the Gulf of Mexico on March 25th, 1940\n- the acquisition of El Greco's \"The Apostles Peter and Paul\" by the State Hermitage in Saint Petersburg\n- the loss of my stuffed chaffinch 'Fringilla coelebs Linnaeus, 1758' due to insect damage last year\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE8(x) ⊃ E7(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
