The first argument must point to an sp:Ask or a SPIN template call that has an ASK query as its body. All subsequent argument can come in pairs, with the first one being a variable name and the second its binding.\n\nExample:\n\n    BIND (spin:ask(?query, \"this\", owl:Thing) AS ?result) .\n\nwill execute the sp:Ask behind ?query with the variable ?this pre-bound to owl:Thing." <http://spinrdf.org/spin> .
