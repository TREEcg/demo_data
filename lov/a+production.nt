The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  \"Aerosol\" means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets).  The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  \"tendency_of_X\" means derivative of X with respect to time.  Aerosol takes up ambient water (a process known as hygroscopic growth) depending on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol. \"Dry aerosol\" means aerosol without water. The term \"particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol\" means all particulate organic matter dry aerosol except black carbon. It is the sum of primary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol and secondary_particulate_organic_matter_dry_aerosol. \"Emission\" means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth's surface). \"Emission\" is a process entirely distinct from \"re-emission\" which is used in some standard names. \"Net chemical production\" means the net result of all chemical reactions within the atmosphere that produce or destroy a particular species." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .
