All NEMA 5 devices are three-wire grounding devices (hot-neutral-ground) rated for 125 V maximum.\n   The 5-15R is by far the most common electrical receptacle in North America in buildings built since the mid-twentieth century. It is usually installed in a duplex configuration; two receptacles may share a common circuit or may each be wired separately, sometimes to a switch." <http://schema.mobivoc.org/> .
