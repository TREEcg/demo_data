Salvador Leptospirosis Study Group. Lancet 354: 820-825.\n\nthe in-text reference pointer to this paper in a journal article may be manifested in a number of ways:\t\n\nNumerically, for example by using the numeral 4 in superscript or between square brackets, thus: [4].  Such numerical in-text \nreference pointers are frequently aggregated, e.g. [4, 5, 6-9].  In such cases, the missing pointers to references 7 and 8 are inferred (and should be added explicitly to the XML mark-up at this point in the text!). \n\nOr by use of the author names (or the first author's name plus et al.) and the publication year in parentheses, thus: (Ko et al., 1999). \n\nOr, less commonly, by the use of a code, e.g. by specifying the first surname letter of the first three author of the cited work followed by the last two digits of the year of publication, this string of characters being enclosed within square brackets, thus: [KRR99]."@en <http://purl.org/spar/c4o> .
