For example a training course, or a play. The primary purpose is to indicate that several events will have very similar content, to aid planning what to attend. It does not indicate that there is any reason people could not attend more than one realisation. It should not be used to abstract a repeating event, such as morning coffee or a monthly meeting.\n\n\nMultiple Events may reference that they are realises of the same Activity. \nActivities are not Events and may not have a time or place." <http://purl.org/prog/> .
