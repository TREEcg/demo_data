<http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sample> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Samples are artifacts of an observational strategy, and have no significant function outside of their role in the observation process. The characteristics of the samples themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.\n\nA Sample is intended to sample some FatureOfInterest, so there is an expectation of at least one isSampleOf property. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .

In the context of the observation model, it connotes the 'world in the vicinity of the station', so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artifact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .
