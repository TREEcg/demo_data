<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Unit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Unit Units are the segmentation of drama. A drama can have multiple\n            segmentations. Units are ordered by some Timeline. Units are devoted to the\n            representation of characters' actions. So, we require that any unit contains at\n            least one action whose description (ProcessSchema) encompasses at least one role having\n            an agent as a filler. If a building collapses, this action, by itself, can be part of\n            Unit only if an agent is involved in it (e.g., an agent dies). This definition\n            guarantees that, in the minimal case, at least one agent appears as filler of the roles\n            in the description of at least an action of every unit. A Unit has one or more actions\n            as its members (hasMember property)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
