By contrast, devices do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.\n\nReagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance can only realize one of these roles in the execution of a given  assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized. In an assay to evaluate the quality of the taq polymerase itself, the evaluant/study subject role of the taq is realized, but not the reagent role since the taq is the subject about which data is generated.\n\nIn regard to the statement that reagents are 'distinct' from the specified outputs of a technique:  note that a reagent may be incorporated into a material output of a technique, as long as the IDENTITY of this output is distinct from that of the bearer of the reagent role.  For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a 'nucleic acid molecule') that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of 'reagent-ness' is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique)." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0100062> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "1. The term 'line' is used when a culture has undergone an intentional experimental process to establish a more uniform and stable population of cells (see 'establishing cell line'). This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, 'lines' are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time. A *new* cell line can be \"established\" not only through the passaging/selection of a primary culture, but also through experimental modifications of existing lines (e.g. immortalization, stable genetic modifications, drug selection for a resistant subset, etc.).  As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quescent state for future use. \n\n2. The definitional criteria provided here for the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.?\n\n3. Definitinal criteria are intended to be sufficiently clear to specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world. A 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this common history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to the collection of all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as cells in these collections will likely not all share a common culture history. Rather, 'HeLa cell line' could refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).  As noted above, it is such collections that are typically referred to in scientific discourse and publications.\n\n4. Notably, the term 'line' has been alternately used by other terminologies and communities to refer to cultures that have been immortalized - ie has attained the capacity for indefinite propagation in vitro.  In this ontology, we refer to such cell lines as 'immortal cell lines', and use the term 'cell line' to indicate any culture that has been passaged." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Subclass axioms were: 'has grain' some 'cell line cell' and 'has grain' only 'cell line cell'\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: There is considerable ambiguity and inconsistent usage surrounding the term 'cell line' across biomedical communities. For exmaple, it can refer to the maximal collection of all cells in a cultured lineage (e.g. the colelction of all HeLa cells that exist), or to discrete portions of this maximal collection that are stored, exchanged, and applied experimentally (e.g. the dish of HeLa cells I am using in my experiment). A working group of representatives from OBI, CLO, and CL was assembled in spring of 2013 to harmonize modeling and terminology surrounding experimentally cultured cells across Open Biomedical Ontologies, following OBO Foundry principles of orthogonality and re-use. A consensus was reached to apply the term 'cell line' to refer not to a maximal collection of cells of a given type, but to discrete populations of cultured cells that share a common propagation history which has conferred a certain a genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to the population.  This meaning reflects its most common usage in domain discourse, and will best support data annotation requirements. This view means that a 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this specific history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to collections such as all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as all cells in these collections do not necessarily share a common culture history. Rather, it could be used to refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).\n\nThis approach seems to accomplish several desirable goals:\n1) It allows us to define the term 'cell line' for the community in a precise way that also reflects how the term is most commonly used in the literature and scientific discourse.\n(2) It gives a definition that provides clear criteria to help specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world\n(3) The criteria it provides demarcate populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.\n(4) The definition seems to be true to the meaning of the word 'line' - which is suggests a specific lineage of derivation." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .
