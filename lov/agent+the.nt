In Gangemi et al. 2002 \"Endurants are wholly present\n            (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present\",\n            differently from perdurants, which are only partially present at any time they are\n            present. Endurants (and Perdurants, in some cases) play a role in processes and states:\n            an Endurant is connected to a role (Role class) in the description of a given process or\n            state by the hasRole object property. The class of drama endurants encompasses more\n            specific drama entities such as Agent and Object. This bipartite distinction is derived\n            from the drama literature, where - Agents that intentionally perform actions; - Objects\n            are involved in the actions in an unintentional way. For instance, in Hamlet, the King\n            of England is a drama endurant (but non an agent) because it is the filler of a role in\n            Claudius' actions (sending ... ) but does not intend any plan (a feature would\n            locate it in the Agent class). The difference beteween the King of England and a coffee\n            machine is entrusted to common sense knowlegde (e.g., the external lexical knowledge\n            stating the sementic type of these two entities).

In drama, it represents the unobservable part of a plan\n            that has not been fully carried out by some agent. Its existence (in the agent's\n            mind) can only be conjectured - remember that a Plan is intended by some agent by\n            definition. As the object of a conjecture, it does not contain any details in the\n            representation of drama (this does not mean that it does not contain them in the\n            agent's mind).

These are the necessary and sufficient conditions of class. Following the\n            paradigm of hierarchical planning, plans are recursive. So plans can contains actions or\n            other, simpler plans. Formally, a Plan is a list (namely, it is a subclass of the List\n            class) whose elements are simpler plans (for abstract plans) or actions (for directly\n            executable plans).

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Agent> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Agent. Derived from BDI model, a mentalist model of agent which sees the agent\n            as a rational entity who form intentions, or plans, (based on her beliefs) to achieve\n            her desires (or goals). See Bratman et al. 1988 and Cohen and Levesque 1995. Agents are\n            those entities in drama, that potentially - have goals (object property hasGoal); -\n            intend plans to achieve goals (object property intends); - participate in actions with\n            some role (object property isFillerOf); In addition, agents have emotional states (as a\n            result of targeted emotions appraisal processes) and have moral values (hasValue): -\n            feel emotions as a result of a cognitive appraisal process (specific object properties\n            link each the appraisal of each emotion type to the agent); - have values (object\n            property hasValue); The requirement, in drama, is that an agent has a plan, since the\n            fact of having a goal would not be sufficient to ensure that the goal is translated into\n            some concrete, perceivable behavior in drama. Having a plan, instead, implies that the\n            agent also has goal. Notice that some Agent (e.g. Polonius) is involved in an action\n            without being intentional (e.g., being the topic of a conversation), it remains\n            classified as an Agent in Drammar, though it fills a different role in the frame (e.g.,\n            Topic of Conversation).

These values are\n            engaged in drama by the execution of the agents' plans. Formally, a Value is\n            a subclass of the MentalState class which is constrained to: - be in a given state, true\n            or false, of the boolean property atStake - be in a ConsistentStateSet (namely, the\n            consequences of some plan that puts the value at stake or brings it back to balance) -\n            be described by a ValueSchema. For example, in the nunnery scene, Ophelia's\n            answer \"At home, my Lord\", being a lie, results in a state that puts at stake\n            Hamlet's value of honesty." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
