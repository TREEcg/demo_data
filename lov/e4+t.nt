<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E2_Temporal_Entity> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods, E5 Events and states, which happen over a limited extent in time. This extent in time must be contiguous, i.e., without gaps. In case the defining kinds of phenomena for an instance of E2 Temporal Entity cease to happen, and occur later again at another time, we regard that the former E2 Temporal Entity has ended and a new instance has come into existence. In more intuitive terms, the same event cannot happen twice.\n\nIn some contexts, these are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item. This is an abstract class and has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.\n\nExamples:\n- Bronze Age (E4)\n- the earthquake in Lisbon 1755 (E5)\n- the Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg being in ruins from 1944 – 1946 (E3)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE2(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

P7took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (generally on the surface of the earth).  For example, the period \"Révolution française\" can be said to have taken place in \"France\", the \"Victorian\" period, may be said to have taken place in \"Britain\" and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and north America.\nA period can take place at multiple locations.\nIt is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place.
