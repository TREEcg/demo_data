It is used as a standard for measurement of the same quantity, where any other value of the quantity can be expressed as a simple multiple of the unit. For example, length is a quantity; the metre is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10 metre (or 10 m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called \"metre\"."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .
