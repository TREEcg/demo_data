<http://purl.org/configurationontology#Configuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A state of the configuration process, assumed to correspond to a valid partially defined product - valid in the sense that it can be completed into an existing fully specified product, one that can be ordered, without changing any of the current selections.\n\nA configuration is defined by a Lexicon (the set of the descriptive attributes of the configured product, cf. the \"lexicon\" property), and by the set of choices that have been made so far (typically  selected specifications), cf. the \"definingChoice\" property.\n\nNote: A configurator application may conceivably have to handle “invalid configurations”, that is, combinations of specifications that are impossible. This can happen, for instance, if the user is allowed to begin the configuration process by choosing features without any control of their compatibility; or if she is allowed to choose a feature incompatible with her previous selections. In this case, it is the responsibility of the configurator application to restore the consistency of the configuration, necessarily by excluding some of the previous user selections. This Configuration class excludes such invalid combinations. \n\nRelation with GoodRelations and schema.org vocabularies :\nbecause a configuration mainly describes a Partially Defined Product, it can be seen as a GoodRelations \"ProductOrServiceModel\" (or a schema.org \"ProductModel): \"an intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced products, in the sense of a prototype\". The suffix \"Model\" may seem misleading when used for a Configuration, as it suggests something such as \"Ford T\", and not \"Ford T with sunroof and climat control (itself not a completely defined product -  you still can choose, well, the color: it is a \"prototype of similar products\").\n\nOn the other hand, a Configuration has a price (more precisely, a \"from price\" - the minimum of the \"suggested retail prices\" of all the matching completely defined products). As such, a Configuration may be seen as a commercial offer. It can also be used to represent a customer's wish list, constrained by the definition of the range. It could therefore be considered as a gr:Offering (or a schema:Offer) as well.\n\nBut gr:ProductOrService and gr:Offering are disjoint classes: a given Configuration cannot be both. Depending on the use case, a publisher of configuration data may want to type her Configurations with either of these classes."@en <http://purl.org/configurationontology> .

<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#TransportWithBiochemicalReaction> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A conversion interaction that is both a biochemicalReaction and a transport. In transportWithBiochemicalReaction interactions, one or more of the substrates changes both their location and their physical structure. Active transport reactions that use ATP as an energy source fall under this category, even if the only covalent change is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.\n\nRationale: This class was added to support a large number of transport events in pathway databases that have a biochemical reaction during the transport process. It is not expected that other double inheritance subclasses will be added to the ontology at the same level as this class.\n\nExamples: In the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system, transportation of sugar into an E. coli cell is accompanied by the sugar's phosphorylation as it crosses the plasma membrane." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
