Somehow structured and interrelated body of information, data, or knowledge. This includes databases, knowledge bases, catalogues, registries, specific lists, etc. All tangible aspects (like media or host) are irrelevant for this class - it only considers the abstract information. What can be considered as a single document is outside the scope of this class, although it can be comprehensive in terms of size and structure."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protonext> .
