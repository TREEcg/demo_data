<https://w3id.org/nno/ontology#SpatialDropout3D> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Spatial 3D version of Dropout.\n\nThis version performs the same function as Dropout, however it drops entire 3D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent pixels within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate decrease. In this case, SpatialDropout3D will help promote independence between feature maps and should be used instead." <https://w3id.org/nno/ontology> .

The modification results in a change to one or more properties and/or geometry descriptions of the modified subject. It should not be used to repair a damaged construction element or spatial zone as cto:RepairTask should be used instead."@en <https://w3id.org/cto> .
