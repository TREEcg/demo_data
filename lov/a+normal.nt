For example this would relate the training course on Thursday to the prog:Activity of the laser safety lecure. All realisations of the laser safety lecture have generally the same content, although details may vary. It is not expected that a normal attendee will attend more than one realisation of an Activity, although certainly not precluded at the level of detail we're working with here." <http://purl.org/prog/> .
