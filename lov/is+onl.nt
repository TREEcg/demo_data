<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#expresses> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This is a large comment field for those who want to investigate the different uses of the 'expresses' relation for modeling different approaches to meaning characterization and modeling.\nFor example, in all these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:\n\n- Beehive means \"a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box.\" (Oxford dictionary)\n- 'Beehive' is a synonym in noun synset 09218159 \"beehive|hive\" (WordNet)\n- 'the term Beehive can be interpreted as the fact of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.'\n- 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas'\n- 'the term Beehive expresses the concept Beehive'\n- ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the same meaning as for, say, fishermen'\n- 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to fit mine'\n- ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives'\n- 'from the term 'Beehive', we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it'\n- the lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame 'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet)\n\nAs the examples suggest, the 'meaning of meaning' is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up formalizing. \nHowever, the usefulness of having a 'semantic abstraction' in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. \nWe provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the 'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.\n\nIn the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). \nAnother approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'.\nStill another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. \nA radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a community use that object.\nAnother approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within texts) in which that object is used similarly.\nThe logical approach to meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. \nFinally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive):\n\n(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference)\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Cognitive meaning (as for 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive system, or neural system of an agent)\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for 'social science' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.)\n\t- Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector space)\n\n(2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between 'expresses' and 'isAbout', which can be used interchangeably)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld\n\nThis is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning. A more developed ontology should approach the problem of integrating the different uses of 'expresses', so that different theories, resources, methods can interoperate." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E4_Period> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\n\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nAs the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\n\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\n\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.\n\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\nJurassic\nEuropean Bronze Age\nItalian Renaissance\nThirty Years War\nSturm und Drang\nCubism\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE4(x) ⊃ E2(x)\nE4(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<https://w3id.org/GConsent#MinorDataSubject> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Minor is a Data Subject who cannot provide their own consent (that is legally valid). Therefore, their consent must be obtained via a Guardian or Legal Representative or Parent. Minor is a subclass of Data Subject.\n\nConsent given in lieu of a Minor (by their Representative) is associated with the `ConsentInstance` class/instance using the `wasGivenBy` property.\n\nThe ontology currently does not capture this relationship between the Minor and their Representative. This is due to required clarifications regarding how this role should be represented. For example, the `DataSubject` cannot be subclassed to create a `Representative` class, as this would make the `DataSubject` a permanent representative for the Minor. Instead, the role of 'acting as representative' is only for the instance of the given consent. Therefore, this could be represented with a `ConsentRepresentativeRole` class that links to the `MinorDataSubject` with `roleHadDataSubject` property, and the `DataSubject` that gave the consent via the `roleHadRepresentative` property. The relationship or reason or situation of this given consent can be captured by further annotating the `ConsentRepresentativeRole` instance. This approach can also be extended to other similar situations where one `DataSubject` gives consent in lieu of another.\n\nNote: A Minor can provide their own consent in certain cases, or conversely, a minor's consent may need to be provided by a 'parental' representative in some cases."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .

As a direct consequence of regarding the DAT Payload as JSON-LD, *all* DAT Payloads must have exactly one \"@context\" attribute with the IDS context URI as its value and a \"@type\" with ids:DatPayload as its value. Note that, different to the DatPayload, the DatRequestPayload contains the *self-claims* of a connector and is not yet signed by any DAPS. Consequently, no other connector must accept a DatRequest object as a DAT. A DatRequest and its contained DatRequestPayload is *only* intended for interactions with a DAPS and *nothing else*!"@en <https://w3id.org/idsa/core> .

<http://data.businessgraph.io/ontology#> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The euBusinessGraph (`ebg:`) ontology represents companies, type/status/economic classification, addresses, identifiers, company officers (e.g., directors and CEOs), and dataset offerings.\n\nIt uses `schema:domainIncludes/rangeIncludes` (which are polymorphic) to describe which properties are applicable to a class, \nrather than `rdfs:domain/range` (which are monomorphic) to prescribe what classes must be applied to each node using a property.\nWe find that this enables more flexible reuse and combination of different ontologies.\nWe reuse the following ontologies and nomenclatures, and extend them where appropriate with classes and properties:\n\n- W3C Org, W3C RegOrg (basic company data), \n\n- W3C Time (officer membership), \n\n- W3C Locn (addresses),\n\n- schema.org (domain/rangeIncludes and various properties)\n\n- DBpedia ontology (jurisdiction)\n\n- NGEO and Spatial (NUTS administrative divisions)\n\n- ADMS (identifiers), \n\n- FOAF, SIOC (blog posts),\n\n- RAMON, SKOS (NACE economic classifications and various nomenclatures),\n\n- VOID (dataset descriptions).\n\nThis is only a reference. See more detail in the [EBG Semantic Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhMOTlIOC6dOK_jksJRX0CB-GIRoiYY6fWtCnZArUhU/edit) google document, which includes an informative description of classes and properties, gives examples and data provider rules, and provides more schema and instance diagrams.\n\n## Overview\nThe figure below gives an overview of the ontology, depicting the main classes and their relationships (i.e., object properties). The ontology covers the following areas:\n\n- Registered Organization: To represent a legal company.\n\n- Identifier System: To represent Identifier Systems. A company can have several Identifiers belonging to different Identifier Systems.\n\n- Officer: To represent associated company officers, e.g., directors.\n\n- Dataset: To represent information about datasets that are offered by company data providers.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-overview.png)\n\n### Registered Organization (company)\nRegistered organizations are the main entities for which information is captured in the euBusinessGraph ontology. The ontology is not concerned with unregistered informal groups. Registered organizations gain legal entity status by the act of registration and are distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in some jurisdictions, sole traders. The figure below shows the classes and properties for representing core data about a registered organization.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-company-classes.png)\n\n### Identifier System\nMechanisms to identify companies in various data sources are essential in integration of data about companies across data sources. A proper understanding of what kind of systems of identifiers can be used for companies is thus necessary in this context. We analyzed various types of identifiers commonly used for companies and collected various properties of the systems they are part of. We modelled identifiers and identifier systems explicitly in the ontology as shown in thew figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-identifier-classes.png)\n\n### Officer\nWe use the membership model of the W3C Organization Ontology in a straightforward way to represent officer data as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-officer-classes.png)\n\n### Dataset Descriptions\nData consumers need to know how many companies are included in a data provider dataset, from which jurisdictions, and what depth of data is included (e.g., which properties, addresses with what geo resolution, etc.). We thus need to express both metadata about the dataset itself, and fine-grained statistics about the content of a dataset, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-dataset-classes.png)\n\n" <http://data.businessgraph.io/ontology#> .
