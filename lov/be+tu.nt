BUTTERFLY: Valve in which a streamlined disc pivots about a diametric axis. CONFIGUREDGATE: Screwdown valve in which the closing gate is shaped in a configured manner to have a more precise control of pressure and flow change across the valve. GLAND: Valve with a tapered seating, in which a rotatable plug is retained by means of a gland and gland packing. GLOBE: Screwdown valve that has a spherical body. LUBRICATEDPLUG: Plug valve in which a lubricant is injected under pressure between the plug face and the body. NEEDLE: Valve for regulating the flow in or from a pipe, in which a slender cone moves along the axis of flow to close against a fixed conical seat. PARALLELSLIDE: Screwdown valve that has a machined plate that slides in formed grooves to form a seal. PLUG: Valve that has a ported plug that can be turned relative to the body seat ports. WEDGEGATE: Screwdown valve that has a wedge shaped plate fitting into tapered guides to form a seal."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
