<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Copula> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Indicates a relationship of equivalency between the subject and predicate or complement of a clause. Verbal copulas have essentially the same morphosyntactic properties as verbs: English  'be', Spanish  'ser', and Russian  'bytâ€™' are illustrations of this class. Nonverbal copular items include the the pro-copula - a demonstrative or personal pronoun which serves as the linker between subject and predicate nominal, and which is obligatory in nominal predication - and particle copulas, which have their origin in a variety of markers of discourse-oriented phenomena such as topicalization, backgrounding, or contrastive focus for subjects or predicates. Zero copula refers to a construction in which the relation between a subject and a nominal predicate is not marked by an overt item. Zero copula is mandatory in some languages, such as Sinhalese, whereas it is conditional or restricted in other languages, such as Russian. [Stassen 2008]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
