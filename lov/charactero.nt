A player can have multiple characters in one game and this connection is used to define all the different characters a player could be playing. Even though a player deletes, trades or loses his/her character in any way, the connection can be kept to contain the playerâ€™s history of owned characters."@en <http://purl.org/net/VideoGameOntology> .
