An instance of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary character string. \n\nIn some cases, the content of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object may completely be represented by a serialized digital content model, such as a sequence of ASCII-encoded characters, an XML or HTML document, or a TIFF image. The property P3 has note allows for the description of this content model. In order to disambiguate which symbolic level is the carrier of the meaning, the property P3.1 has type can be used to specify the encoding (e.g. \"bit\", \"Latin character\", RGB pixel). \n\nExamples:\n- 'ecognizabl' \n- The \"no-smoking\" sign (E36) \n- \"BM000038850.JPG\" (E75) \n- image BM000038850.JPG from the Clayton Herbarium in London (E38) \n- The distribution of form, tone and colour found on Leonardo da Vinci's painting named \"Mona Lisa\" in daylight (E38)\n- The Italian text of Dante's \"Divina Commedia\" as found in the authoritative critical edition La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4) (E33)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE90(x) ⊃ E28(x)\nE90(x) ⊃ E72(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

In the wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and musical themes. However, conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E89 Propositional Object. This should not be confused with the definition of a type, which is indeed an instance of E89 Propositional Object.\n\nExamples:\n- Maxwell's Equations\n- The ideational contents of Aristotle's book entitled 'Metaphysics' as rendered in the Greek texts translated in … Oxford edition…\n- The underlying prototype of any \"no-smoking\" sign (E36)\n- The common ideas of the plots of the movie \"The Seven Samurai\" by Akira Kurosawa and the movie \"The Magnificent Seven\" by John Sturges\n- The image content of the photo of the Allied Leaders at Yalta published by UPI, 1945 (E38)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE89(x) ⊃ E28(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
