The exact meaning of _interact_ is defined by sub properties of `seas:connectedTo`.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the electricity to directly flow between an electric vehicle service equipment and an electric vehicle, then they must be linked by property `seas:exchangesElectricityWith`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nseas:exchangesElectricityWith rdfs:subPropertyOf seas:connectedTo .\r\n\r\n<electric_vehicle> seas:exchangesElectricityWith <electric_vehicle_service_equipment> .\r\n```\r\n\r\nProperty `seas:connectedTo` is symmetric:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif x seas:connectedTo y, then it is true that y seas:connectedTo x.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis property can be qualified using class `seas:Connection`, which connects the two systems.\r\n\r\nIf there is a connection between several systems, then one may infer these systems are pairwise connected."@en <https://w3id.org/seas/SystemOntology> .
