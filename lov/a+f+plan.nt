<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DramaEndurant> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DramaEndurant is an entity of drama that can be described as an endurant\n            following Gangemi et al. 2002. In Gangemi et al. 2002 \"Endurants are wholly present\n            (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present\",\n            differently from perdurants, which are only partially present at any time they are\n            present. Endurants (and Perdurants, in some cases) play a role in processes and states:\n            an Endurant is connected to a role (Role class) in the description of a given process or\n            state by the hasRole object property. The class of drama endurants encompasses more\n            specific drama entities such as Agent and Object. This bipartite distinction is derived\n            from the drama literature, where - Agents that intentionally perform actions; - Objects\n            are involved in the actions in an unintentional way. For instance, in Hamlet, the King\n            of England is a drama endurant (but non an agent) because it is the filler of a role in\n            Claudius' actions (sending ... ) but does not intend any plan (a feature would\n            locate it in the Agent class). The difference beteween the King of England and a coffee\n            machine is entrusted to common sense knowlegde (e.g., the external lexical knowledge\n            stating the sementic type of these two entities).

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Action> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An Action is an intentional Process, which is a type of Process. Formally, an\n            action is an Process which is constrained to be contained (isMemberOf) some Unit. In\n            Drammar, an Action can be part of a plan of an agent (formally, a plan ia a list of\n            actions), or can be included in a Unit (ordered into some timeline). Only direct\n            executable plans (DirectlyExecutablePlan class) contain actions The Action class is\n            formally disjoint with the UnintentionalEventiveProcess class. We have introduced an\n            explicit boolean datatype property isIntentional, because it could be that the\n            annotators will use actions directly in the units (i.e. without explicitly introducing a\n            plan for it)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
