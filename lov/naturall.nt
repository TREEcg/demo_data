So things like transiently transfected plasmids and siRNAs would qualify as instances of this second class, but not of 'genetic material' as defined here.\n\nAlso, OBI needs to import a class representing virions for an axiom on genetic material (part_of some (cell or virion)." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops back to the floor where the cycle begins again."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
