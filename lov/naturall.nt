<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0001868> <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000116> "MHB 3-22-13: Discussions are ongoing about the label of this class, given consideration of a second class that covers nucleic acid parts of cells or virions that participate in gene expression processes as a template for expression or a direct effector of expression of some other genetic element (e.g. an siRNA), but are not necessarily heritable by progeny or inherited from ancestors.  So things like transiently transfected plasmids and siRNAs would qualify as instances of this second class, but not of 'genetic material' as defined here.\n\nAlso, OBI needs to import a class representing virions for an axiom on genetic material (part_of some (cell or virion)." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops back to the floor where the cycle begins again."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
