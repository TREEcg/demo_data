Systems can be connected to other systems. Connected systems interact in some ways. Systems can also have subsystems. Properties of subsystems somehow contribute to the properties of the supersystem."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4syst/> .

<https://w3id.org/cto#RepairTask> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A specialized type of a (planned or executed) construction task that repairs a damaged construction element or spatial zone. The subjects of this type of task are construction damages. Depending on the degree of modeling, a repair task can either directly result in the lifting of a damage (and its influence on properties of the damaged object) or subtasks can be defined e.g. to remove a damaged construction component and replace it by a new one."@en <https://w3id.org/cto> .
