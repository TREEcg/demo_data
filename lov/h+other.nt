<http://purl.org/configurationontology#Configuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A state of the configuration process, assumed to correspond to a valid partially defined product - valid in the sense that it can be completed into an existing fully specified product, one that can be ordered, without changing any of the current selections.\n\nA configuration is defined by a Lexicon (the set of the descriptive attributes of the configured product, cf. the \"lexicon\" property), and by the set of choices that have been made so far (typically  selected specifications), cf. the \"definingChoice\" property.\n\nNote: A configurator application may conceivably have to handle “invalid configurations”, that is, combinations of specifications that are impossible. This can happen, for instance, if the user is allowed to begin the configuration process by choosing features without any control of their compatibility; or if she is allowed to choose a feature incompatible with her previous selections. In this case, it is the responsibility of the configurator application to restore the consistency of the configuration, necessarily by excluding some of the previous user selections. This Configuration class excludes such invalid combinations. \n\nRelation with GoodRelations and schema.org vocabularies :\nbecause a configuration mainly describes a Partially Defined Product, it can be seen as a GoodRelations \"ProductOrServiceModel\" (or a schema.org \"ProductModel): \"an intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced products, in the sense of a prototype\". The suffix \"Model\" may seem misleading when used for a Configuration, as it suggests something such as \"Ford T\", and not \"Ford T with sunroof and climat control (itself not a completely defined product -  you still can choose, well, the color: it is a \"prototype of similar products\").\n\nOn the other hand, a Configuration has a price (more precisely, a \"from price\" - the minimum of the \"suggested retail prices\" of all the matching completely defined products). As such, a Configuration may be seen as a commercial offer. It can also be used to represent a customer's wish list, constrained by the definition of the range. It could therefore be considered as a gr:Offering (or a schema:Offer) as well.\n\nBut gr:ProductOrService and gr:Offering are disjoint classes: a given Configuration cannot be both. Depending on the use case, a publisher of configuration data may want to type her Configurations with either of these classes."@en <http://purl.org/configurationontology> .

Compounds that activate the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.\n\nThe following term can not be used in the catalysis class:\nINHIBITION: General inhibition. Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.\n\nThe following terms can only be used in the modulation class (these definitions from EcoCyc):\nINHIBITION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric inhibitors decrease the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that decreases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX. Allosteric inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors, therefore, those inhibition categories can be used in conjunction with this category.\n\nINHIBITION-COMPETITIVE\nCompetitive inhibitors are compounds that competitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and preventing the substrate from binding. Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme. A competitive inhibitor can either bind to the active site of the enzyme, directly excluding the substrate from binding there, or it can bind to another site on the enzyme, altering the conformation of the enzyme such that the substrate can not bind to the active site.\n\nINHIBITION-IRREVERSIBLE\nIrreversible inhibitors are compounds that irreversibly inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme and dissociating so slowly that it is considered irreversible. For example, alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.\n\nINHIBITION-NONCOMPETITIVE\nNoncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that noncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme by binding reversibly to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other. However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.\n\nINHIBITION-OTHER\nCompounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized, but that cannot be clearly classified as irreversible, competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or allosteric.\n\nINHIBITION-UNCOMPETITIVE\nUncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that uncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone.\n\nACTIVATION-NONALLOSTERIC\nNonallosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by means other than allosteric.\n\nACTIVATION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

Its intensional semantics is intended as an area of knowledge (or culture).\n\nThe ontology is partly based on Chris Welty's formal ontology of subjects (DKE, 1999). Subtopic, near, and far relations are pretty similar to the ones defined there. The main differences are:\n- topics are intended here as collections of social objects, not as regions; there is anyway a morphism to the mereo-topological notion of Welty's, since for each topic as a collection we can define a topic space (a subclass of dul:Region) that corresponds to Welty's topics;\n- subjects in Welty's ontology, which are points in a topic region, are intended here in two ways:\n(1) as a dul:SocialObject that hasTopic a Topic. A dul:SocialObject in this case contains references to any entity that (in Welty's terms) 'is about' a topic\n(2) as a Subject, which is characterized here as a subclass of Topic, which isTopicOf exactly 1 dul:SocialObject\n\nFor example, in Welty's theory, given a football event, there can be a subject for that event that is a point in the space of a topic, e.g. 'football'. In this ontology, this is represented as a dul:Event (the actual football event) that dul:isReferenceOf some dul:InformationObject (e.g. a report or article about the football event); such information object hasTopic a Topic (e.g. football). \nTherefore, this solution has specific counterparts to Welty's theory, although the intuition is very different: Welty's topics correspond here to Topic(s), Welty's subjects correspond here to parts of Topic(s), and Welty's individual entities in a domain ontology correspond here to any Entity that dul:isReferenceOf a dul:InformationObject that dul:expresses a dul:SocialObject that hasTopic a Topic.\n\nOn the other hand, a geometrical conception of topics, for example the one assumed by LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis), might take advantage from the addition of topic spaces into the ontology, because one could use dimensional space operators, as well as take input and produce outputs into an ontology by reasoning over topic spaces.\nFor this reason, in this version of the ontopic ontology, we also provide the classes TopicSpace and SubjectSpace, and link them to Topic(s) through the relation dul:isRegionFor; the advantage is that we have a dual encoding of topics, which get either a commonsensical semantics as collections of documents, notions, or any other dul:SocialObject, or a mereotopological semantics as dul:Region(s). The second semantics can be used jointly with LSA geometrical semantics." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl#Topic> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A topic, or subject, argument, domain, theme, subject area, etc.\nTopics have a controversial intuition across common sense, document management systems, knowledge organization systems, etc.\nHere we conceptualise a semiotic notion of iol:Topic as 'a (usually potential) dul:Collection of dul:SocialObject(s). \nFor example, 'music' is a topic constituted by the set of social objects that are associated with music-related entities. Such social objects can be information objects (texts, documents, words, images) about music-related entities, concepts classifying music-related entities, descriptions of musical theories and systems, etc.\nThe relation between social objects and topics is called here 'hasTopic', and is a rdfs:subPropertyOf dul:isMemberOf\nSpecific topics for e.g. a conversation or an article (therefore, closer to the notion of 'title' or 'entry') are called Subject(s).\n\nThere is an interesting duality of topics: they are commonly interpreted as areas of shared knowledge within a Community (therefore as collections of social objects). On the other hand, existing directories and thesauri use 'topic' (or 'subject') more restrictively, as a relation between a document and a concept. \nThere is a sense of 'meaning' that can be reduced to the one given here to Topic (cf. the comment at the property dul:expresses), but in general there seems to be enough room to distinguish carefully between concepts and topics. \nFor example, thesauri do not usually distinguish when their 'concepts' (cf. skos:Concept) are actually intended as concepts (in the sense of dul:Concept) and when they are intended as topics. The distinction is clear when you compare these two sample sentences: 'the football topic is part of the sport topic' vs. 'the concept of football is part of the concept of sport'. \nWhile the first is perfectly acceptable, the second is counterintuitive and even possibly wrong. This effect is due to the fact that concepts are 'intensional' notions and are not intended as areas of knowledge, document spaces, etc., which are 'extensional' notions.\nAccordingly to these basic observations, in this ontology dul:Concept and Topic result to be disjoint, and an appropriate representation should be in place in order to model thesauri. E.g. skos:Concept should be mapped to the union of dul:Concept and Topic." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E77_Persistent_Item> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises items that have a persistent identity, sometimes known as \"endurants\" in philosophy.\n\nThey can be repeatedly recognized within the duration of their existence by identity criteria rather than by continuity or observation. Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names. \n\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci\n- Stonehenge\n- the hole in the ozone layer\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics\n- the Bermuda Triangle\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE77(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

On one hand, there are units that are derived by adding a prefix to the unit. The prefix is a name or associated symbol (e.g. kilo) that precedes a unit of measure (e.g. meter) to form a decimal multiple or submultiple (e.g. Kilometer). Derived units, obtained by the application of a prefix, measure the same physical quality as its base unit. On the other hand, there are another kind of simple derived units that are also obtained from exactly one base unit but they measure a different physical quality. They are obtained by changing the exponent of the unit in the dimensional equation. For instance, this is how square meters are derived from meters. This exponent is represented in MUO with the datatype property muo:dimensionalSize. Combining this two patterns we can represent units that are obtained from a prefix and that have a dimension size different from 1, for instance, the unit square kilometer."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .

<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/OrdinalScale> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The ordinal type allows for rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative degree of difference between them. Examples include, on one hand, dichotomous data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as 'sick' vs. 'healthy' when measuring health, 'guilty' vs. 'innocent' when making judgments in courts, 'wrong/false' vs. 'right/true' when measuring truth value, and, on the other hand, non-dichotomous data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree', 'completely disagree' when measuring opinion."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
