<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#ControlledVocabulary> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: This class represents a term from an external controlled vocabulary (CV).\nRationale: Controlled Vocabularies mark cases where BioPAX delegates the representation of a complex biological phenomena to an external controlled vocabulary development effort such as Gene Ontology. Each subclass of this class represents one such case and often has an associated \"Best-Practice\" external resource to use. See the documentation of each subclass for more specific information. Correct usage of controlled vocabularies are critical to data exchange and integration.\nUsage: The individuals belonging to this class must unambiguously refer to the source controlled vocabulary. This can be achieved in two manners:\nThe xref property of this class is restricted to the unification xref class. It must point to the source controlled vocabulary.\nAlternatively the rdf-id of the member individuals can be set to the designated MIRIAM URN.\nIt is a best practice to do both whenever possible.\nAlthough it is possible to use multiple unification xrefs to identify semantically identical terms across alternative controlled vocabularies, this is not a recommended practice as it might lead to maintenance issues as the controlled vocabularies change.\nThere is no recommended use-case for directly instantiating this class. Please use its subclasses instead." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

Stub classes are provided for time, geometry and measure (scaled number), which can be substituted at run-time by a suitable concrete representation of the concept. \r\nObservation Collection has been (re-)introduced, to support the common case where a collection is homogeneous in one or more properties (feature-of-interest, phenomenon-time, observed-property, units-of-measure, procedure). The value of the common property may be recorded against the collection instead of repetitively against every member.   \r\n\r\nIn this revision, the observation result is an Object Property, in order to conform to strict OWL2 semantics. The type constraints on Observation specializations TruthObservation and CountObservation have been changed, so that the range of oml:result is an Object containing the xsd type, rather than the data-type itself.
