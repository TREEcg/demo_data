<http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop#TimeInterval> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This is a general time expression, which refers to a particular period of time, an interval. Repeating periods (like Spring or Christmas) are not time intervals, while specific instances of them (like the Spring of 1944) are. A TimeInterval could collapse, in very special cases, to a time point, however in this case, in contrast to the Abstract time point (referring to some time during the day), it should be bound to a specific date, i.e. to represent a timestamp."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .
