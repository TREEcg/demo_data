In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a \"taxon,\" the type description as a \"protologue,\" and the exemplary specimens as \"orgininal element\" or \"holotype\".\n\nExamples:\n- creation of the taxon 'Penicillium brefeldianum B. O. Dodge' (1933)\n- addition of class E84 Information Carrier to the CIDOC CRM\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE83(x) âŠƒ E65(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
