A constraint ranges over a set of individuals. RECO considers several kind of constraint expressions: (1) conjunction of constraints: \"music from the sixties\"; (2) disjunction of constraints: \"music or films\"; (3) composition of constraints: \"cars with powerful engines\"; (4) datatype constraints based on boolean operators: \"released before 1980\"."@en <http://purl.org/reco#> .
