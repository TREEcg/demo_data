<https://w3id.org/seas/Service> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In economics, a service is an economic activity where an immaterial exchange of value occurs. When a service such as labor is performed the buyer does not take exclusive ownership of that which is purchased, unless agreed upon by buyer and seller. The benefits of such a service, if priced, are held to be self-evident in the buyer's willingness to pay for it (source: Wikipedia).\r\n    "@en <https://w3id.org/seas/TradingOntology> .

The delegated consent is provided through the mechanism of a _delegation_. This involves three entities - the Data Subject the delegation occurs for, the entity that acts as the delegate, and the mechanism used to verify the authority to delegate. They (first two) are provided respectively by the properties `isConsentDelegationFor`, and `hasConsentGivenByDelegate`."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
