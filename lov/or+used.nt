Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. Moreover it expresses similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons.\n\n\nExamples:\n- the Parthenon Frieze on the Acropolis in Athens (E22) shows features of the Original Parthenon Frieze in the British museum (E22). Kind of similarity: Copy (E55)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP130 (x,y) ⊃ E70(x)\nP130 (x,y) ⊃ E70(y)\nP130(x,y,z) ⊃ [P130(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\nP130(x,y) ⊃ P130(y,x)\n\nProperties: P130.1 kind of similarity: E55 Type"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

Discrete pieces of raw-materials kept in museums, such as bricks, sheets of fabric, pieces of metal, should be modelled individually in the same way as other objects. Discrete used or processed pieces, such as the stones from Nefer Titi's temple, should be modelled as parts (cf. P46 is composed of).\n\nThis type is used categorically in the model without reference to instances of it, i.e. the Model does not foresee the description of instances of instances of E57 Material, e.g.: \"instances of  gold\".\n\nIt is recommended that internationally or nationally agreed codes and terminology are used.\n\nExamples:\n- brick\n- gold\n- aluminium\n- polycarbonate\n- resin\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE57(x) ⊃ E55(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
