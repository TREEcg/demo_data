<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Action> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An Action is an intentional Process, which is a type of Process. Formally, an\n            action is an Process which is constrained to be contained (isMemberOf) some Unit. In\n            Drammar, an Action can be part of a plan of an agent (formally, a plan ia a list of\n            actions), or can be included in a Unit (ordered into some timeline). Only direct\n            executable plans (DirectlyExecutablePlan class) contain actions The Action class is\n            formally disjoint with the UnintentionalEventiveProcess class. We have introduced an\n            explicit boolean datatype property isIntentional, because it could be that the\n            annotators will use actions directly in the units (i.e. without explicitly introducing a\n            plan for it)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
