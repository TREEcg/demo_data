Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an E6 Destruction and E7 Activity.\n\nThe decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive:\n1.  If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as E6 Destruction.\n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as E11 Modification.\n\nExamples:\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD\n- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7)\n- the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE6(x) ⊃ E64(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#GeometryRestructuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The GeometryRestructuration concept is a sub concept of the StructureChange concept. It describes changes that simultaneously affect several TSNFeature by modifying their Geometry and sometime other attributs of the TSNFeatures. The set of TSNFeatures (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the GeometryRestructuration event is determined following the rule described by (Plumejeaud C, Mathian H, Gensel J, Grasland C. Spatio-temporal analysis of territorial changes from a multi-scale perspective. International Journal of Geographical Information Science. 25, 1597–1612 (2011)):\"For any event type, a geometrical invariant defines the set of units involved in the one event: the combination of unit footprints that existed prior the event (preceding ones) is equal to the combination of unit footprints that are still in existence after the event (succeeding ones).\". Except in case of GeometryRestructuration caused by a TerritoryChange that affect the external boundaries of the TerritoryVersion observed. Then, in this case, the set of TSNFeature (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the StructureChange event is determined following the rule: changes are grouped together if they occur simultaneously, inside a area which extends from the new territory boundaries to unit(s) boundaries that match the ones of unit(s) before the event. This concept is equivalent to the \"evolution of spatial structure\" notion from (Claramunt C, Thériault M. Managing Time in GIS An Event-Oriented Approach. In: Clifford J, Tuzhilin A, editors. Recent Advances in Temporal Databases. London: Springer London; 1995. p. 23–42. Available from: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4471-3033-8_2)."@en <http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#> .
