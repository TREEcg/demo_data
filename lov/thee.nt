<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#catalysisDirection> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This property represents the direction of this catalysis under all\nphysiological conditions if there is one.\n\nNote that chemically a catalyst will increase the rate of the reaction\nin both directions. In biology, however, there are cases where the\nenzyme is expressed only when the controlled bidirectional conversion is\non one side of the chemical equilibrium. For example E.Coli's lac operon ensures that lacZ gene is only synthesized when there is enough lactose in the medium.  If that is the case and the controller, under biological conditions, is always catalyzing the conversion in one direction then this fact can be\ncaptured using this property. If the enzyme is active for both\ndirections, or the conversion is not bidirectional, this property should\nbe left empty." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
