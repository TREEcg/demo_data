<http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf#Curve> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "\nA Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object usually stored as a sequence of Points, with the subtype of Curve specifying the form of the interpolation between Points. This specification defines only one subclass of Curve, LineString, which uses linear interpolation between Points.\nA Curve is a 1-dimensional geometric object that is the homeomorphic image of a real, closed, interval.\nA Curve is simple if it does not pass through the same Point twice with the possible exception of the two end\npoints.\nA Curve is closed if its start Point is equal to its end Point.\nThe boundary of a closed Curve is empty.\nA Curve that is simple and closed is a Ring.\nThe boundary of a non-closed Curve consists of its two end Points.\nA Curve is defined as topologically closed, that is, it contains its endpoints f(a) and f(b).\n    "@en <http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf> .

Or should this be cut up a little? Say one file for the general CERT ontology, and then files for RSA, DSA, PGP, etc... Or perhaps it does not really matter?\n     - expand more on the certification side of things\n     - verify this by security experts\n     - owl2 has some constructs for combined inverse functional properties. \n       This may be useful to use in defining an RSA key which is identified\n       by two numbers.\n     - also create html version of the spec by using this as a template.\n     - should comments such as this be in html?\n   "@en <http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/cert#> .
