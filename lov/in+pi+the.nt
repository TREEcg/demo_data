Each data source has its own personal information graph. When a data source is deleted, the graph becomes redundant and should also be deleted. If two or more items in two or more data source graphs are determined to be equivalent, they are integrated at the PIMO level, and the integrated representation plus the links to the original items are stored in the pimo:PersonalInformationModel graph." <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/01/19/nie> .
