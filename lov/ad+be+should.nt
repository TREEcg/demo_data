If more than one geometry description should be added to an object, the relation omg:hasGeometry to a new individual of the type omg:Geometry should be used for each geometry description. This step is necessary to allow interconnections between the geometry descriptions regarding their derivation or complementation for easier upkeep of data integrity. The introduction of subproperties of this property for specific geometry descriptions (e.g. OntoBREP, GEOM, OntoSTEP) may ease querying for wanted geometry description formats."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .

In case the geometry description is text-based or in a binary file format, it can be directly added to this property, if it is a file-based geometry description, the URI linking to the file should be added to this property. Should multiple geometries be added to the object, the omg:Geometry class with its relation (omg:hasGeometry) or even geometry states (omg:GeometryState and omg:hasGeometryState) should be introduced for each geometry resp. geometry version."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .

<https://w3id.org/omg#GeometryState> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A geometry state is an evaluation holding the geometry description and metadata about a geometry that was true for the given time. \nIn case of geometry states, changing geometric properties does not cause the need for a new geometry state as long as the property was changed using the OPM concepts. If this is not the case, a copy of the now valid graph must be created and attached to a new geometry state. If an object within the geometry graph is changed (e.g. changing the primitive \"Box\" into a primitive \"Sphere\"), the old primitive (\"Box\") should be classified as opm:Deleted and the new primitive (\"Sphere\") should be added to the geometry graph in the correct place. The new geometry state should then be connected to any object of the geometry graph that is not opm:Deleted using the omg:containsGeometryObject relation.\nMetadata of a geometry state must as a minimum be the time of generation stated by prov:generatedAtTime, but preferably also a prov:wasAttributedTo reference to the agent who created the state. In case properties are changed using the OPM concepts, the most current time of generation and agent who created the state will be determined using the omg:containsPropertyState relation.\nDerived geometry descriptions are also stored as states as these change when the base geometry changes."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
