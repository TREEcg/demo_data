It includes a start date and an end date, both of which are included in the DateRange. Thus, for example, the DateRange.startDate might be 01 March 2003, the DateRange.endDate might be 5 March 2003, and the DateRange would include the days 01,02,03,04 and 05 March 2003." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .
