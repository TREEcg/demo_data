<http://purl.org/configurationontology#Configuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A state of the configuration process, assumed to correspond to a valid partially defined product - valid in the sense that it can be completed into an existing fully specified product, one that can be ordered, without changing any of the current selections.\n\nA configuration is defined by a Lexicon (the set of the descriptive attributes of the configured product, cf. the \"lexicon\" property), and by the set of choices that have been made so far (typically  selected specifications), cf. the \"definingChoice\" property.\n\nNote: A configurator application may conceivably have to handle “invalid configurations”, that is, combinations of specifications that are impossible. This can happen, for instance, if the user is allowed to begin the configuration process by choosing features without any control of their compatibility; or if she is allowed to choose a feature incompatible with her previous selections. In this case, it is the responsibility of the configurator application to restore the consistency of the configuration, necessarily by excluding some of the previous user selections. This Configuration class excludes such invalid combinations. \n\nRelation with GoodRelations and schema.org vocabularies :\nbecause a configuration mainly describes a Partially Defined Product, it can be seen as a GoodRelations \"ProductOrServiceModel\" (or a schema.org \"ProductModel): \"an intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced products, in the sense of a prototype\". The suffix \"Model\" may seem misleading when used for a Configuration, as it suggests something such as \"Ford T\", and not \"Ford T with sunroof and climat control (itself not a completely defined product -  you still can choose, well, the color: it is a \"prototype of similar products\").\n\nOn the other hand, a Configuration has a price (more precisely, a \"from price\" - the minimum of the \"suggested retail prices\" of all the matching completely defined products). As such, a Configuration may be seen as a commercial offer. It can also be used to represent a customer's wish list, constrained by the definition of the range. It could therefore be considered as a gr:Offering (or a schema:Offer) as well.\n\nBut gr:ProductOrService and gr:Offering are disjoint classes: a given Configuration cannot be both. Depending on the use case, a publisher of configuration data may want to type her Configurations with either of these classes."@en <http://purl.org/configurationontology> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl#Topic> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A topic, or subject, argument, domain, theme, subject area, etc.\nTopics have a controversial intuition across common sense, document management systems, knowledge organization systems, etc.\nHere we conceptualise a semiotic notion of iol:Topic as 'a (usually potential) dul:Collection of dul:SocialObject(s). \nFor example, 'music' is a topic constituted by the set of social objects that are associated with music-related entities. Such social objects can be information objects (texts, documents, words, images) about music-related entities, concepts classifying music-related entities, descriptions of musical theories and systems, etc.\nThe relation between social objects and topics is called here 'hasTopic', and is a rdfs:subPropertyOf dul:isMemberOf\nSpecific topics for e.g. a conversation or an article (therefore, closer to the notion of 'title' or 'entry') are called Subject(s).\n\nThere is an interesting duality of topics: they are commonly interpreted as areas of shared knowledge within a Community (therefore as collections of social objects). On the other hand, existing directories and thesauri use 'topic' (or 'subject') more restrictively, as a relation between a document and a concept. \nThere is a sense of 'meaning' that can be reduced to the one given here to Topic (cf. the comment at the property dul:expresses), but in general there seems to be enough room to distinguish carefully between concepts and topics. \nFor example, thesauri do not usually distinguish when their 'concepts' (cf. skos:Concept) are actually intended as concepts (in the sense of dul:Concept) and when they are intended as topics. The distinction is clear when you compare these two sample sentences: 'the football topic is part of the sport topic' vs. 'the concept of football is part of the concept of sport'. \nWhile the first is perfectly acceptable, the second is counterintuitive and even possibly wrong. This effect is due to the fact that concepts are 'intensional' notions and are not intended as areas of knowledge, document spaces, etc., which are 'extensional' notions.\nAccordingly to these basic observations, in this ontology dul:Concept and Topic result to be disjoint, and an appropriate representation should be in place in order to model thesauri. E.g. skos:Concept should be mapped to the union of dul:Concept and Topic." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .
