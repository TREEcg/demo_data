The range is not explicit in the definition of the annotation property because it would turn the ontology to OWL Full. E.g. The participation pattern is extracted from the Dolce Ultra Lite ontology, hence the value for this annotation property is http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl" <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl> .
