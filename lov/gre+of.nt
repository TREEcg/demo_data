This class does not imply initiative by either party. It may be the initiative of a third party.\n\nTypical scenarios include the termination of membership in a social organisation, ending the employment at a company, divorce, and the end of tenure of somebody in an official position.\n\nExamples:\n- The end of Sir Isaac Newton's duty as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge to the Convention Parliament in 1702\n- George Washington's leaving office in 1797\n- The implementation of the treaty regulating the termination of Greenland’s membership in EU between EU, Denmark and Greenland February 1. 1985\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE86(x) ⊃ E7(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
