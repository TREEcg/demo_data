RF connectors are typically used with coaxial cables and are designed to maintain the shielding that the coaxial design offers. Better models also minimize the change in transmission line impedance at the connection. Mechanically they provide a fastening mechanism (thread, bayonet, braces, push pull) and springs for a low ohmic electric contact while sparing the gold surface thus allowing above 1000 reconnects and reducing the insertion force. Research activity in the area of radio-frequency (RF) circuit design has surged in the last decade in direct response to the enormous market demand for inexpensive, high data rate wireless transceivers.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"RF connector\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_connector) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .
