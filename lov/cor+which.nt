<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Timeline> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Timeline Timeline is a subclass of List whose function is to impose some\n            ordering on the units in a drama. Notice that the notion of timeline cannot be collapsed\n            onto the actual text: rather, it is simply an indexing posed upon units (which\n            correspond to a manifestation of drama in FRBR sense). In formal terms, the orders\n            object property has Timeline as its domain and units as its range, so a unit\n            \"orders\" some units. A Timeline contains unit. Formally, the elements\n            (OrderedListElements class) contained in a timeline (containsOLE property) are units. A\n            Timeline is surrounded by states of affairs that hold before and after it, namely\n            instances of the ConsistentSateSets class that precede and follow a given timeline.\n            Formally, the Timeline class is the domain of the hasTimelineEffect(Precondition)\n            properties, which have the ConsistentStateSet class as their range. A timeline is\n            motivated by some plan (motivates object property) and is spanned by some unit (span\n            object property). The relation between units and timelines is independent of the\n            scene/timeline relation." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Scene> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scene Drama is divided into scenes, which correspond to an extent of the\n            'text' of drama. Scenes (as a type of TreeNode) form a hierarchy, which\n            represents the recursive nature of drama. This is obtained by implementing the Scene\n            class as a subclass of the TreeNode class. Scenes contains children scenes: this\n            relation is modeled through the hasChild property. All scenes span some timeline (spans\n            object property), i.e., they have a correspondance with some extent of the drama text\n            (represented by the Timeline class)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
