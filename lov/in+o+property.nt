The range should be constrained to Boolean. Agents, for which the value is True, correspond to instances of http://www.cyc.com/2003/04/01/cyc#LegalAgent, which is defined as follows \"Each instance of #LegalAgent is an agent who has some status in a particular legal system. At the very least, such an agent is recognized by some legal authority as having some kinds of rights and/or responsibilities as an agent (e.g., #citizens of Germany), ... \".

Stub classes are provided for time, geometry and measure (scaled number), which can be substituted at run-time by a suitable concrete representation of the concept. \r\nObservation Collection has been (re-)introduced, to support the common case where a collection is homogeneous in one or more properties (feature-of-interest, phenomenon-time, observed-property, units-of-measure, procedure). The value of the common property may be recorded against the collection instead of repetitively against every member.   \r\n\r\nIn this revision, the observation result is an Object Property, in order to conform to strict OWL2 semantics. The type constraints on Observation specializations TruthObservation and CountObservation have been changed, so that the range of oml:result is an Object containing the xsd type, rather than the data-type itself.
