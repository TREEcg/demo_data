<https://w3id.org/con-tax#ConstructionSubComponent> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A construction component that forms, formed or has the potential to form a part of another construction component. It can be distinguished from other types of construction components since they are, in normal situations, no individual components. An example are the steps and railings as sub components of a stairs component. Use a more specific subclass from a dedicated taxonomy such as BEO based on IFC or AAT-ARCH based on the Getty AAT concepts related to constructions."@en <https://w3id.org/con-tax> .
