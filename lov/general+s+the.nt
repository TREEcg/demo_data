This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Collection often referred to with the name of the E78 Collection (e.g. \"The Wallace Collection decided…\").\n\nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Collection. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.\n\nExamples:\n- The John Clayton Herbarium\n- the Wallace Collection\n- Mikael Heggelund Foslie's coralline red algae Herbarium at Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE78(x) ⊃ E24(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The concept of physical quality is similar to the notion of quality, used in metrology, the science of measurement. We distinguish between: 1) A physical quality in the general sense: a kind of physical property ascribed to phenomena that can be quantified for a particular phenomenon (e.g. length and electrical charge); 2) A physical quantity in the particular sense: a quantifiable property ascribed to a particular phenomenon (e.g. the weight of my device). MUO only uses physical quantities in the general sense."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .
