E67 Birth is a biological event focussing on the context of people coming into life. (E63 Beginning of Existence comprises the coming into life of any living beings).\n\nTwins, triplets etc. are brought into life by the same E67 Birth event. The introduction of the E67 Birth event as a documentation element allows the description of a range of family relationships in a simple model. Suitable extensions may describe more details and the complexity of motherhood with the intervention of modern medicine. In this model, the biological father is not seen as a necessary participant in the E67 Birth event.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Alexander the Great\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE67(x) âŠƒ E63(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
