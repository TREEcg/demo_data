In the first version of the SSN ontology, this concept was defined as a subproperty of dul:hasQuality. dul:hasQuality is a relation between entities and qualities, e.g. 'Dmitri's skin is yellowish'.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following RDF graph describes that feature of interest `<fridge/1>` has property `<fridge/1/consumption>` .\r\n\r\n```\r\n<fridge/1> seas:hasProperty <fridge/1/consumption> .\r\n```\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology> .
