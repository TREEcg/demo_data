As there's no official support for ensuring sequential ordering of tuples, we advise putting sequential numbers into the URLs of fixes to be able to retrieve the spatial footprint of the trajectory. Another solution is querying using an ORDER BY statement that sorts by the time:Interval of each Fix that composes the RawTrajectory."@en <http://purl.org/net/step> .
