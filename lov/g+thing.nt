<http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance/ThingGraph> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Thing graphs hold metadata about a single thing. Note the difference with Datasets, which hold metadata about many things. Thing graphs are usually exposed to user friendly tools which allow users with little on no RDF skills to specifically edit a metadata about a thing in a form. For example a thing graph can contain metadata about a football team such as its various names, LOD links for the team, a short disambiguation hint, e.t.c. Thing graphs are also used to store metadata about things obtained from a feed, for example store metadata about locations obtained from a Location Services feed."@en-gb <http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance> .

<http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance/managedBy> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Associates the thing graph of a cms:ManagedThing with its managing system. This is needed to solve cases where different systems can manage metadata about a shared thing. E.g., one thing graph from BBC News may have all the politics related metadata for David Cameron, while another thing graph managed by Knowledge and Learning may contain information about the historical role David Cameron has played as a conservative leader in British politics. Separating metadata into thing graphs is useful for managing information about shared things."@en-gb <http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance> .
