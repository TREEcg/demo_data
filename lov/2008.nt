Native speakers have the ability to â€˜work outâ€™ the gender of a noun, and models of this ability have been called â€˜gender assignment systemsâ€™. So far, the concept of â€˜assignment of a feature valueâ€™ has not been used outside gender. For some features, there may not be as much to say as for gender. However, using the concept of â€˜assignmentâ€™ with respect to the values of all features is useful to be able to compare the features. Therefore, for this typology I have adopted the following definition: an assignment system is a set of rules that realise the value of a feature on an element. Note, however, that under this definition, a gender value is â€˜assignedâ€™ both to nouns, and to targets of agreement in gender with the noun.

This distinction was proposed by Corbett (1991) to account for the criteria according to which nouns can be allotted to genders. Corbett demonstrates that gender assignment systems in languages can be semantic or semantic-and-formal â€“ that is, the set of rules that determine the assignment of inherent gender values to nouns refer to the meaning of words, or a combination of the meaning of words and the form of words.

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Lexicon> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In its most general sense, the term is synonymous with vocabulary. A dictionary can be seen as a set of lexical entries. The lexicon has a special status in generative grammar, where it refers to the component containing all the information about the structural properties of the lexical items in a language. [Crystal 2008: 278] In linguistics, ... we don't normally speak of the vocabulary of a particular language; instead, we speak of the lexicon, the total store of words available to a speaker. Very commonly, the lexicon is not regarded merely as a long list of words. Rather, we conceive the lexicon as a set of lexical resources, including the morphemes of the languages, plus the processes available in the language for constructing words from those resources. Apart from the lexicon of a language as a whole, psycholinguists are interested in the mental lexicon, the words and lexical resources stored in an individual brain.
