<http://purl.org/ontology/mo/MusicalWork> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "\n    Distinct intellectual or artistic musical creation.\n    \nFrom the FRBR final report: A work is an abstract entity; there is no single material object one can point to as the work. We recognize the work through individual realizations or expressions of the work, but the work itself exists only in the commonality of\ncontent between and among the various expressions of the work. When we speak of Homer's Iliad as a work, our point of reference is not a particular recitation or text of the work, but the intellectual creation that lies behind all the various expressions of the work.     \n\nFor example:\n\nwork #1 J. S. Bach's The art of the fugue\n\n    \n    " <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .

A virtual link is a connection between resources such as literals and instances with some commonality. Each of these resources is from a different RDF dataset. A resource mapping can be also considered when defining common resources between datasets. For example, the datasets uses different prefix namespaces for similar instances in a given domain scope. A virtual link can be interpreted as an intersection data point between two datasets. In addition, a virtual link is not concretely stored. The link may be physically established during a federated query execution, for example. This class must only have instances of its subclasses. It is recommendable to comment (rdfs:comment) the scope of the virtual link set."@en <http://purl.org/query/voidext> .
