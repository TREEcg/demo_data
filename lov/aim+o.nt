<https://w3id.org/GDPRov> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an European law governing the use of consent and personal data. Some of its obligations involve concepts related to the lifecycles of consent and personal data. Such obligations are concerned with how the collection, use, processing, sharing, and storing of consent and personal data takes place and provides the motivation for a form of documentation that can demonstrate the required information towards compliance. GDPRov is an OWL2 ontology for representing this information as provenance metadata using terms relevant to the GDPR. It extends PROV-O and P-Plan to represent the lifecyles as an abstract model of how things should happen or will happen (future) as well as instance of what has happened (past). The ontology is being developed as part of contributions towards PhD research by its primary author." <https://w3id.org/GDPRov> .
<https://w3id.org/GDPRov> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "GDPRov is an ontology for expressing provenance metadata in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its compliance. It extends PROV-O and P-Plan. PROV-O is the ontology based on the PROV model, a W3C recommendation, while P-Plan is an extension of PROV-O. PROV is used to define terms or 'instances' of what has happened in the past, while P-Plan is used to define the abstract model or 'Plan' of things to happen. GDPRov uses P-Plan to create a template/model/plan as an abstract or model representation of a system which is then recorded using PROV-O instances to show something has happened. The aim of the ontology is to enable representation of consent and personal data lifecycles using terms relevant to GDPR and to facilitate expression of this information towards documentation related to compliance." <https://w3id.org/GDPRov> .

<http://caressesrobot.org/ontology> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:\n\n- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?\n- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? \n- Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?\n- Topics of conversation.  Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?\n\nThe CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:\n\n- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner\n- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.\n- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted person’s preferences and needs.\n\nPlease refer to the following for additional information:\n- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;\n- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.
