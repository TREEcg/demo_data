<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl#Context> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any context, such as:\n\n- dul:Situation (the circumstantial context of denoted Entity(ies))\n- Paradigm (the cultural context of expressed Meaning(s))\n- CoText (the informational context of Expression(s))\n- dul:Description (the relational context of Concept(s))\n- KnowledgeCommunity (the social context of conceptualizing Agent(s))\n- dul:Place (the spatial context of Entity(ies))\n\nbut also a dul:PhysicalPlace, a dul:Event, etc. In practice, everything that is said to be a context for something else.\n\nNotice that certain contexts can be given independently from the entities that are contextualized (e.g. the ones listed above), others need a core entity and a rule to build its neighborhood, and still others can be classified as such when a certain relation is applied to them.\nFor example, a scientific theory is a dul:Description that works as a context for its dul:Concept(s), and can be given independently from the concepts, which can remain implicit to a certain extent. On the contrary, a CoText is actually a neighborhood of a certain chunk of text, which can be built based on a syntagmatic rule (all words from the sentence where the chunk occurs), an associative rule (all terms that are related to the chunk across the texts of a corpus, given a certain statistical threshold), etc.\nContexts can also emerge based on what relations are considered \"context triggers\". For example, in this ontology very different relations: part, participation, setting, membership, acting for, localization, etc. are considered context triggers by adding owl:subPropertyOf axioms to the property: isContextOf. Since the class Context has an equivalent axiom to isContextOf someValuesFrom dul:Entity, everything has a property that is declared subPropertyOf isContextOf, will be inferred to be a Context as well." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> .
