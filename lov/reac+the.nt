<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#catalysisDirection> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This property represents the direction of this catalysis under all\nphysiological conditions if there is one.\n\nNote that chemically a catalyst will increase the rate of the reaction\nin both directions. In biology, however, there are cases where the\nenzyme is expressed only when the controlled bidirectional conversion is\non one side of the chemical equilibrium. For example E.Coli's lac operon ensures that lacZ gene is only synthesized when there is enough lactose in the medium.  If that is the case and the controller, under biological conditions, is always catalyzing the conversion in one direction then this fact can be\ncaptured using this property. If the enzyme is active for both\ndirections, or the conversion is not bidirectional, this property should\nbe left empty." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

For example, in a biochemical reaction, the participants are the union of the reactants and the products of the reaction. This property has a number of sub-properties, such as LEFT and RIGHT used in the biochemicalInteraction class. Any participant listed in a sub-property will automatically be assumed to also be in PARTICIPANTS by a number of software systems, including Protege, so this property should not contain any instances if there are instances contained in a sub-property." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

That is, not a quality of an abstract entity as is also allowed by DUL's Quality, but rather an aspect of an entity that is intrinsic to and cannot exist without the entity and is observable by a sensor, or operable by an actuator. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a property may also itself be a feature of interest. For example if a fridge uses alternative current energy, then several aspects of its energy consumption property may be quantified. Examples of such aspects include:\r\n\r\n- the active power consumption;\r\n- the reactive power consumption;\r\n- the phase of voltage relative to current;\r\n- the frequency;\r\n- the minimal operating value of the frequency;\r\n- the number of occurences of unusual values.\r\n\r\nThese are different properties of the same property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nex:activePower a owl:ObjectProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:subPropertyOf seas:hasProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:domain seas:PowerProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:range seas:PowerProperty .\r\n\r\n<fridge/1/consumption> a seas:FeatureOfInterest ;\r\n  ex:activePower <fridge/1/consumption/activePower> .\r\n```\r\n\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology> .
