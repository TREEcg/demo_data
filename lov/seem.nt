This can happen, for instance, if the user is allowed to begin the configuration process by choosing features without any control of their compatibility; or if she is allowed to choose a feature incompatible with her previous selections. In this case, it is the responsibility of the configurator application to restore the consistency of the configuration, necessarily by excluding some of the previous user selections. This Configuration class excludes such invalid combinations. \n\nRelation with GoodRelations and schema.org vocabularies :\nbecause a configuration mainly describes a Partially Defined Product, it can be seen as a GoodRelations \"ProductOrServiceModel\" (or a schema.org \"ProductModel): \"an intangible entity that specifies some characteristics of a group of similar, usually mass-produced products, in the sense of a prototype\". The suffix \"Model\" may seem misleading when used for a Configuration, as it suggests something such as \"Ford T\", and not \"Ford T with sunroof and climat control (itself not a completely defined product -  you still can choose, well, the color: it is a \"prototype of similar products\").\n\nOn the other hand, a Configuration has a price (more precisely, a \"from price\" - the minimum of the \"suggested retail prices\" of all the matching completely defined products). As such, a Configuration may be seen as a commercial offer. It can also be used to represent a customer's wish list, constrained by the definition of the range. It could therefore be considered as a gr:Offering (or a schema:Offer) as well.\n\nBut gr:ProductOrService and gr:Offering are disjoint classes: a given Configuration cannot be both. Depending on the use case, a publisher of configuration data may want to type her Configurations with either of these classes."@en <http://purl.org/configurationontology> .

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/FutureTense> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A value of Tense Property assigned to the designated element in the clause when the meaning selected for the clause is that intended to locate the event spoken about as posterior to the deictic centre of the utterance. Most commonly, this tense meaning is referred to as 'future', because in absolute tense systems the deictic centre is the moment of speech. However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'posterior'. The posterior temporal relation may obtain either in 'simple' or 'perfect' contexts. Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach 1947], who suggested using a third point in time, 'reference point', to capture all possible tense distinctions. In all 'simple' temporal relations, the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. 'Perfect' tense meanings are created when the reference point is separated and moved away from the event time, thus altering the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. Posterior temporal relationships obtaining in a 'perfect' context occur when the reference point is moved away from the event time. There are various logical possibilities for locating the reference point with respect to the other two points, though none of them seem to be typically grammaticalised as separate tenses. Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Future Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the posterior temporal relationship, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings.

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#expresses> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This is a large comment field for those who want to investigate the different uses of the 'expresses' relation for modeling different approaches to meaning characterization and modeling.\nFor example, in all these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:\n\n- Beehive means \"a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box.\" (Oxford dictionary)\n- 'Beehive' is a synonym in noun synset 09218159 \"beehive|hive\" (WordNet)\n- 'the term Beehive can be interpreted as the fact of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.'\n- 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas'\n- 'the term Beehive expresses the concept Beehive'\n- ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the same meaning as for, say, fishermen'\n- 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to fit mine'\n- ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives'\n- 'from the term 'Beehive', we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it'\n- the lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame 'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet)\n\nAs the examples suggest, the 'meaning of meaning' is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up formalizing. \nHowever, the usefulness of having a 'semantic abstraction' in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. \nWe provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the 'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.\n\nIn the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). \nAnother approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'.\nStill another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. \nA radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a community use that object.\nAnother approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within texts) in which that object is used similarly.\nThe logical approach to meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. \nFinally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive):\n\n(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference)\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Cognitive meaning (as for 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive system, or neural system of an agent)\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for 'social science' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.)\n\t- Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector space)\n\n(2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between 'expresses' and 'isAbout', which can be used interchangeably)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld\n\nThis is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning. A more developed ontology should approach the problem of integrating the different uses of 'expresses', so that different theories, resources, methods can interoperate." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

Such social objects can be information objects (texts, documents, words, images) about music-related entities, concepts classifying music-related entities, descriptions of musical theories and systems, etc.\nThe relation between social objects and topics is called here 'hasTopic', and is a rdfs:subPropertyOf dul:isMemberOf\nSpecific topics for e.g. a conversation or an article (therefore, closer to the notion of 'title' or 'entry') are called Subject(s).\n\nThere is an interesting duality of topics: they are commonly interpreted as areas of shared knowledge within a Community (therefore as collections of social objects). On the other hand, existing directories and thesauri use 'topic' (or 'subject') more restrictively, as a relation between a document and a concept. \nThere is a sense of 'meaning' that can be reduced to the one given here to Topic (cf. the comment at the property dul:expresses), but in general there seems to be enough room to distinguish carefully between concepts and topics. \nFor example, thesauri do not usually distinguish when their 'concepts' (cf. skos:Concept) are actually intended as concepts (in the sense of dul:Concept) and when they are intended as topics. The distinction is clear when you compare these two sample sentences: 'the football topic is part of the sport topic' vs. 'the concept of football is part of the concept of sport'. \nWhile the first is perfectly acceptable, the second is counterintuitive and even possibly wrong. This effect is due to the fact that concepts are 'intensional' notions and are not intended as areas of knowledge, document spaces, etc., which are 'extensional' notions.\nAccordingly to these basic observations, in this ontology dul:Concept and Topic result to be disjoint, and an appropriate representation should be in place in order to model thesauri. E.g. skos:Concept should be mapped to the union of dul:Concept and Topic." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E74_Group> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises any gatherings or organizations of E39 Actors that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder\nof the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the Group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group..\n\nA gathering of people becomes an E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an E74 Group (cf. HumanML markup). Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group. \n\nExamples:\n- the impressionists\n- the Navajo\n- the Greeks\n- the peace protestors in New York City on February 15 2003\n- Exxon-Mobil\n- King Solomon and his wives\n- the President of the Swiss Confederation\n- Nicolas Bourbaki \n- Betty Crocker\n- Ellery Queen\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE74(x) ⊃ E39(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "ProVoc (Product Vocabulary) est un vocabulaire qui peut être utilisé pour représenter des informations et les manipuler à travers le Web. L'ontologie permet de représenter : 1) La hiérarchie d'une société : Groupe (Entreprise), Divisions d'un groupe, Marques d'une division ou d'un groupe, 2) La production d'une société : Gammes de produits (attachées à une marque), produits d'une gamme, packages de produits (un panier alimentaire par exemple), composition des produits...\n\nQuels apports ? \n\n- pv:Range\nDans ProVoc, nous introduisons les gammes de produits pv:Range.\nGoodRelations défini des variantes de produits  (http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/Product_variants, http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html#isVariantOf) : \"A variant is a specialization of a product model and inherits all of its product properties, unless they are defined locally. This allows a very compact modeling of product models that vary only in  a few properties.\"\nD'après GoodRelations, une variante d'un MacBook est par exemple un MacBook13Inch ou un MacBook15Inch qui varient par leur taille d'écran  et la quantité de ports USB disponibles. Il s'agit d'héritage entre un produit « parent » et ses dérivés qui doivent respecter les normes imposées par le produit « parent » (à moins de redéfinir les valeurs). Dans la version actuelle de GoodRelations, il existe une relation gr:isVariantOf nécessairement entre deux modèles de produits ou service. Or, les gammes de produits peuvent difficilement être traitées comme un ensemble de dérivés d'un produit/modèle commun. Par exemple, Elsève est une gamme proposant des shampooings avec des dérivés, mais Elsève propose aussi des Colorations avec des dérivés,  des Huiles avec des dérivés etc etc, donc à part qu'il s'agit de traitement pour les cheveux, ces  produits n'ont pas grand-chose en commun. En utilisant gr:isVariantOf entre certains produits « proches », on aurait plusieurs clusters de produits apparentés, au détriment d'une gamme unique. L'utilisation de pv:Range permet de respecter la structure fournie par l'expert, non subjective.\nEn conclusion, les variantes semblent pertinentes pour identifier des produits similaires (voir également http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo qui ne se différencie de isVariantOf que par le fait que le domain et le range de isSimilarTo sont plus large), mais les gammes de produits ont une toute autre vocation.\ngr:isVariantOf a une sémantique très large et subjective (comme pour isSimilarTo, d’ailleurs M. Hepp le dit clairement ici http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo). Par exemple, rien n’empêche d’exprimer qu’une Renault Clio 4 est une variante d’une Ford Fiesta (http://www.autonews.fr/nouveautes/nouveaute/104216-renault-clio-fiesta-prix/ pourtant elles ne sont pas de la même marque.  \nEnfin, notons qu'une pv:Range ne représente ni un produit ni un modèle de produit. pv:Range permet de lier une marque à ses produits de façon non subjective (fournie par l’expert). \nIl serait pertinent de limiter l’utilisation de gr:isVariantOf aux produits appartenant à une pv:Range.\n\n- pv:Package\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons la classe pv:Package qui permet de représenter des ensembles de produits vendus comme un unique produit. Par exemple un coffret de cosmétique contenant une BB crème, un gloss, et le parfum La vie est Belle de Lancôme. Un autre exemple est un panier alimentaire contenant différents produits.\n\n- pv:Provider\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons pv:Provider qui représente les fournisseurs de produits (par exemple Carrefour est fournisseur des produits Nutella).\n\n- pv:Component\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons pv:Component qui permet de décrire la composiiton d'un produit (par exemple, un parfum peut contenir du linalool).\n\nD'autres classes et propriétés sont introduites dans ProVoc dans le but de raffiner le modèle. Par exemple, pv:Model, pv:Designer, et pv:Ambassador sont des sous-classes de foaf:Person. ProVoc permet aussi de lier les composants d'un produit avec leur impact sur la santé (pv:healthImpact).\n\nConcernant les propriétés classiques liées directement au produit, telles que la couleur, le prix, la référence, la description, etc, voir Good Relations.\n"@fr <http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> .

<http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "ProVoc (Product Vocabulary) is a vocabulary that can be used to represent information and manipulate them through the Web. This ontology reflects: 1) The basic hierarchy of a company: Group (Company), Divisions of a Group, Brand names attached to a Division or a Group, and 2) The production of a company: products, ranges of products (attached to a Brand), the composition of a product, packages of products...\n\n\nWhat contributions ? \n\n- pv:Range\nIn ProVoc we introduce pv:Range.\nGoodRelations defined \"variants\" ( http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/Product_variants , http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html#isVariantOf ) as following: \"\"A variant is a specialization of a product model and inherits all of its product properties, unless they are defined locally. This allows a very compact modeling of product models that vary only in  a few properties. \"\nAccording to GoodRelations, a variant of a MacBook is for example a MacBook13Inch or MacBook15Inch which vary in screen size and in available USB ports. This is inheritage between a product model and its derivatives, which must meet the standards imposed by the product model (obviously values can be redefined locally). According to the current version of GoodRelations,gr:isVariantOf necessarily exists between two models of product or service. However, ranges of products can hardly be considered as a set of derivatives of a product (or model of product). For example, Elsève is a range of products offering shampoos with some derivatives, but Elsève also offers creams with derivatives, oils with derivatives etc., so apart that such products are related to treatment for hair, they have not much in common. Using gr:isVariantOf between certain 'close' products, we would obtain multiple clusters of related products, to the detriment of a unique range of products. Using pv:Range allows to respect the structure provided by the expert.\nIn conclusion, variants seem to identify similar products (see also http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo which differs from gr:isVariantOf by the fact that the domain and ranks of isSimilarTo are larger), but pv:range has a different vocation.\ngr:isVariantOf has a very broad and subjective semantics (such as gr:isSimilarTo, as Mr. Hepp said clearly here http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo ). For example , with gr:isVariantOf it would be possible to express that a Renault Clio 4 is a variant of a Ford Fiesta ( http://www.autonews.fr/nouveautes/nouveaute/104216-renault-clio-fiesta-prix/ yet they are not of the same brand) whilst they are not of the same brand name.\nFinally, note that a pv:Range does not represent a set of products nor product models. pv:range is used to objectively link a brand to its products (provided by the expert).\nIt would be appropriate to limit the use of gr:isVariantOf to products belonging to a pv:Range.\n\n- pv:Package\nIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Package class that is used to represent sets of products sold as a single product. For example a cosmetic box containing a BB cream, a lip gloss, and a perfume byl Lancôme. Another example is a food package that contains different products.\n\n- pv:Provider\nIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Provider that makes a product available in the e-commerce.\n\n- pv:Component\nIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Component which enables to describe the composition of a product (for instance, a perfume can contain linalool).\n\nWe  introduce more properties and classes in order to refine the model. For instance, pv:Model, pv:Designer, and pv:Ambassador appear as a subclass of foaf:Person.  ProVoc can also be used in order to link products and their components with their impact on health ( see pv:healthImpact).\n\nConcerning classic properties related to the product, such as color, price, reference, description, etc., see Good Relations (http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/).\n"@en <http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> .

Unlike <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/ItemList\">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as tv, radio and games).<br/><br/>\n\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/TVSeries\">TVSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/RadioSeries\">RadioSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/MovieSeries\">MovieSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/BookSeries\">BookSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/Periodical\">Periodical</a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/VideoGameSeries\">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case, the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/hasPart\">hasPart</a> / <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/isPartOf\">isPartOf</a> properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.<br/><br/>\n\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate." <http://schema.org/> .
