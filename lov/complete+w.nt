The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Details of methods and devices are best handled as free text, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon 14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of:) E55 Type.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of height of silver cup 232 on the 31st August 1997\n- the carbon 14 dating of the \"Schoeninger Speer II\" in 1996 [an about 400.000 years old Palaeolithic complete wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany in 1995]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE16(x) ⊃ E13(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

Any instance of E29 Design or Procedure may be associated with other designs or procedures. The property is considered to be symmetrical unless otherwise indicated by P69.1 has type.\nThe P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.\nThe property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.\n\nExamples:\n- Procedure for glass blowing (E29) has association with procedure for glass heating (E29) \n- The set of instructions for performing Macbeth in Max Reinhardt's production in 1916 in Berlin at Deutsches Theater (E29) has association with the scene design drawing by Ernst Stern reproduced at http://www.glopad.org/pi/fr/record/digdoc/1003814 (E29) has type has part (E55) \n- Preparation of parchment (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type 'has part' (E55). Preparation of parchment (E29) has association with stretching of skin (E29) has type 'has part' (E55). Stretching of skin (E29) has association with soaking and unhairing of skin (E29) has type 'follows' (E55).\n- The plan for reassembling the temples at Abu Simbel (E29) has association with the plan for\nstoring and transporting the blocks (E29) has type 'follows' (E55)'.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP69 (x,y) ⊃ E29(x)\nP69 (x,y) ⊃ E29(y)\nP69(x,y,z) ⊃ [P69(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\nP69(x,y) ⊃P69(y,x)\n\nProperties: P69.1 has type: E55 Type"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
