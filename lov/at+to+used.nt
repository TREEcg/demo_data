This node can be used to attach additional information to the information as author, time of creation, geometry context or dependencies with other geometry descriptions as transformations, complementations or derivations. By creating subclasses of this class for specific types of geometry descriptions (e.g. OBJ, GEOM, glTF), more informational value can be added and used in querying for specific geometry description formats."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
