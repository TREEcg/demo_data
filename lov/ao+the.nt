<http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#SemanticAnnotation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An ro:SemanticAnnotation is a specialisation of ao:Annotation which requires that ao:body points to an RDF Graph.\n\nThis might be a Named Graph or a resource which can be resolved separately from the URI given by ao:body.\n\nThis graph SHOULD mention the resources identified by ao:annotatesResource from this annotation, preferably by using their URIs as subject or object of statements.\n\nNote that this use of ao:body is distinct from ao:hasTopic, which also allows the association of a an RDF Graph with an ao:Annotation, but which also implies that this graph is the \"topic\" (subproperty of bookmark:hasTopic) of the annotated resource. This class does not require this interpretation, it is merely enough that the annotation body mentions the annotated resource, for instance to give it a dc:title or to relate two annotated resources.  Also note that the next version of the AO ontology (v2) might change this definition of ao:hasTopic, removing the need for this class."@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro> .

<http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#AggregatedAnnotation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An annotation aggregated within an ro:ResearchObject.  \n\nInstances of this class are used to annotated resources aggregated within the aggregating research object, proxies of these resources, or the research object itself. In other words, if :ro is the ro:ResearchObject this annotation has been ore:isAggregatedBy, then the annotation should have at least one ao:annotatesResource which is an ore:AggregatedResource which is ore:isAggregatedBy :ro, or the annotated resource is an ore:Proxy which ore:proxyIn :ro, or the annotated resource is :ro.\n\nIt is possible for the annotation to also annotate non-aggregated resources, but as above, at least one of them needs to be part of the RO or the RO itself.\n\nAs a subclass of ro:SemanticAnnotation the ao:body must point to an rdfg:Graph which contains the actual annotation.
