Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.\n\nThis classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually less time-dependent than the property value." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/sam-lite> .

<https://w3id.org/nno/ontology#SpatialDropout3D> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Spatial 3D version of Dropout.\n\nThis version performs the same function as Dropout, however it drops entire 3D feature maps instead of individual elements. If adjacent pixels within feature maps are strongly correlated (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then regular dropout will not regularize the activations and will otherwise just result in an effective learning rate decrease. In this case, SpatialDropout3D will help promote independence between feature maps and should be used instead." <https://w3id.org/nno/ontology> .
