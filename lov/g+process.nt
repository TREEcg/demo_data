This is usually done to improve the audio quality or adjust for more modern playback equipment. The process generally doesn't involve changing the music in any artistically important way. It may, however, result in tracks that are a few seconds longer or shorter." <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .

A process generalizes the concept of `ssn:Sensing` in the SSN ontology, and of `san:Acting` in the SAN ontology. Examples of processes include sensing, acting, planning, or forecasting.\n\nIn the first version of the SSN ontology, `ssn:Process` was a subclass of `dul:Method`.\n\nA `dul:Method` is a Description that defines or uses concepts in order to guide carrying out actions aimed at a solution with respect to a problem. It is different from a Plan, because plans could be carried out in order to follow a method, but a method can be followed by executing alternative plans."@en <https://w3id.org/pep/> .
