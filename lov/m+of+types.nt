<http://caressesrobot.org/ontology> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:\n\n- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?\n- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? \n- Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?\n- Topics of conversation.  Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?\n\nThe CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:\n\n- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner\n- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.\n- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted person’s preferences and needs.\n\nPlease refer to the following for additional information:\n- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;\n- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.

Emotion 2. Belief 3. Goal 4. Value Belief and\n            Goal are traditionally described as having a propositional content because they both\n            concern some attitude of the agent toward a proposition; in Drammar, we don't\n            enforce this distinction because the reference theoriesd we adopt for emotion and values\n            also enforce some time of propositional content. The only difference is that only the\n            schema types for beliefs and goals (BeliefSchema and GoalSchema) have a propositional\n            content attached to it (through the propositionalContent object property). A MentalState\n            is defined as an EventiveState that is described by a MentalStateSchema. The latter are\n            to be specified as EmotionSchema, BeliefSchema, GoalSchema, ValueSchema,\n            depending on the MentalState type: so, the MentalStateSchema type works as a selector\n            for the right trait of the mental schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

Ballasts are needed to operate Discharge Lamps such as Fluorescent, Compact Fluorescent, High-pressure Mercury, Metal Halide and High-pressure Sodium Lamps. Magnetic ballasts are chokes which limit the current passing through a lamp connected in series on the principle of self-induction. The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz)."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
