The delegated consent is provided through the mechanism of a _delegation_. This involves three entities - the Data Subject the delegation occurs for, the entity that acts as the delegate, and the mechanism used to verify the authority to delegate. They (first two) are provided respectively by the properties `isConsentDelegationFor`, and `hasConsentGivenByDelegate`."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
