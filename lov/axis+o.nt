The platform orientation is the direction in which the \"front\" or longitudinal axis of the platform is pointing (not necessarily the same as the direction in which it is travelling, called platform_course)." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .

BUTTERFLY: Valve in which a streamlined disc pivots about a diametric axis. CONFIGUREDGATE: Screwdown valve in which the closing gate is shaped in a configured manner to have a more precise control of pressure and flow change across the valve. GLAND: Valve with a tapered seating, in which a rotatable plug is retained by means of a gland and gland packing. GLOBE: Screwdown valve that has a spherical body. LUBRICATEDPLUG: Plug valve in which a lubricant is injected under pressure between the plug face and the body. NEEDLE: Valve for regulating the flow in or from a pipe, in which a slender cone moves along the axis of flow to close against a fixed conical seat. PARALLELSLIDE: Screwdown valve that has a machined plate that slides in formed grooves to form a seal. PLUG: Valve that has a ported plug that can be turned relative to the body seat ports. WEDGEGATE: Screwdown valve that has a wedge shaped plate fitting into tapered guides to form a seal."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
