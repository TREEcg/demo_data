Because of the inexplicitness with which these terms were traditionally defined and the restricted nature of their definitions, it has become preferable to use such terms as word-class or form-class, where the grouping is based on formal criteria of a more universally applicable kind.

The paper is the medium on which the song can be perceived, reproduced and communicated. \nIt is not necessary that the medium be such that a human can perceive the work, as long as the work can be perceived by a machine. Thus, the song is also fixed the moment the author records it onto a cassette tape. Similarly, a computer program is fixed when stored on a computer hard drive.\nFrom the legal point of view, the fixations that are governed are those that store performances of works. The more important kinds of fixations are sound recordings and motion pictures. \nThe theme of a Record is a Performance but it is not necessarily a public performance. For instance, it can be a studio performance, which is governed by copyright because this fixation is intended for commercial exploitation."@en <http://rhizomik.net/ontologies/copyrightonto.owl> .

The approach for this subontology is to have a hierarchy of location classes, such that instances of the classes further down in the hierarchy can be contained in instances of the classes higher up in the hierarchy. On each level, there exist two sister classes: class L defines a certain type of location, while class SubL defines locations which can be contained in instances of L. SubL then defines a property inL, to express which instance of L an instance of SubL is contained in. E.g. for a class Continent, there exists a class SubContinent. All children of SubContinent (either direct or transitive) define locations that can be contained in a continent, such as countries, regions, cities, etc. By virtue of inheritance, all these location classes then have a property inContinent, to express that they are contained in some continent. In a simpler, flat structure, inContinent would have to be defined explicitly for all kinds of locations that can be contained in a continent.\nThe intepretation of the inL predicates should be as follows: if, for a particular instance K, inL has a value, this value is valid. If inL has no value, the value of inL in the next location K is contained in valid, and so forth. E.g. an instance \"Hawaii\" has the value \"Oceania\" defined for <link>inContinent</link> and \"USA\" for <link>inCountry</link>. \"Delaware\" has no value for inContinent. \"USA\" has the value \"North America\" for <link>inContinent</link>. The interpretation would be that \"Hawaii\" is located in \"Oceania\", while \"Delaware\" is located in \"North America\".\nWe are aware of the fact that this approach is idealized and can therefore conflict with reality in some situations. E.g., the exact borders of continents are not always defined (there are contradicting opinions on where exactly Europe begins or ends). Countries could be contained in more than one continent (Turkey belongs to both Europe and Asia). However, we think that these situations are marginal and have little or no impact on the intended use of this ontology.\nWe think that this recursive modelling of locations is at the same time simple and powerful enough to capture all necessary aspects of the concept of location for a domain such as an SWPortal. While the SubL classes might appear to be somewhat artificial, they are actually not. They are just an abstraction for geographical entities that are (under normal circumstances) smaller than entities of type L. As such, they are no more abstract than, say, the concept of an agent.\n" <http://sw-portal.deri.org/ontologies/swportal> .

Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.\n\nThe following terms can only be used in the modulation class (these definitions from EcoCyc):\nINHIBITION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric inhibitors decrease the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that decreases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX. Allosteric inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors, therefore, those inhibition categories can be used in conjunction with this category.\n\nINHIBITION-COMPETITIVE\nCompetitive inhibitors are compounds that competitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and preventing the substrate from binding. Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme. A competitive inhibitor can either bind to the active site of the enzyme, directly excluding the substrate from binding there, or it can bind to another site on the enzyme, altering the conformation of the enzyme such that the substrate can not bind to the active site.\n\nINHIBITION-IRREVERSIBLE\nIrreversible inhibitors are compounds that irreversibly inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme and dissociating so slowly that it is considered irreversible. For example, alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.\n\nINHIBITION-NONCOMPETITIVE\nNoncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that noncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme by binding reversibly to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other. However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.\n\nINHIBITION-OTHER\nCompounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized, but that cannot be clearly classified as irreversible, competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or allosteric.\n\nINHIBITION-UNCOMPETITIVE\nUncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that uncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone.\n\nACTIVATION-NONALLOSTERIC\nNonallosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by means other than allosteric.\n\nACTIVATION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes. \nSpecific subclasses of E41 Appellation should be used when instances of E41 Appellation of a characteristic form are used for particular objects. Instances of E49 Time Appellation, for example, which take the form of instances of E50 Date, can be easily recognised.\nE41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf.

If the E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.\n"@en <http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E18_Physical_Thing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, man-made or natural.\n\nDepending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.\n\nAn instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.\n\nWe model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThe CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.\n\nExamples:\n- the Cullinan Diamond (E19)\n- the cave \"Ideon Andron\" in Crete (E26)\n- the Mona Lisa (E22)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE18(x) ⊃ E72(x)\nE18(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

If the E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.\n\nExamples:\n- the removal of the engine from my car\n- the disposal of object number 1976:234 from the collection\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE80(x) ⊃ E11(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The term 'line' is used when a culture has undergone an intentional experimental process to establish a more uniform and stable population of cells (see 'establishing cell line'). This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, 'lines' are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time. A *new* cell line can be \"established\" not only through the passaging/selection of a primary culture, but also through experimental modifications of existing lines (e.g. immortalization, stable genetic modifications, drug selection for a resistant subset, etc.).  As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quescent state for future use. \n\n2. The definitional criteria provided here for the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.?\n\n3. Definitinal criteria are intended to be sufficiently clear to specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world. A 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this common history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to the collection of all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as cells in these collections will likely not all share a common culture history. Rather, 'HeLa cell line' could refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).  As noted above, it is such collections that are typically referred to in scientific discourse and publications.\n\n4. Notably, the term 'line' has been alternately used by other terminologies and communities to refer to cultures that have been immortalized - ie has attained the capacity for indefinite propagation in vitro.  In this ontology, we refer to such cell lines as 'immortal cell lines', and use the term 'cell line' to indicate any culture that has been passaged." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Subclass axioms were: 'has grain' some 'cell line cell' and 'has grain' only 'cell line cell'\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: There is considerable ambiguity and inconsistent usage surrounding the term 'cell line' across biomedical communities. For exmaple, it can refer to the maximal collection of all cells in a cultured lineage (e.g. the colelction of all HeLa cells that exist), or to discrete portions of this maximal collection that are stored, exchanged, and applied experimentally (e.g. the dish of HeLa cells I am using in my experiment). A working group of representatives from OBI, CLO, and CL was assembled in spring of 2013 to harmonize modeling and terminology surrounding experimentally cultured cells across Open Biomedical Ontologies, following OBO Foundry principles of orthogonality and re-use. A consensus was reached to apply the term 'cell line' to refer not to a maximal collection of cells of a given type, but to discrete populations of cultured cells that share a common propagation history which has conferred a certain a genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to the population.  This meaning reflects its most common usage in domain discourse, and will best support data annotation requirements. This view means that a 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this specific history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to collections such as all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as all cells in these collections do not necessarily share a common culture history. Rather, it could be used to refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).\n\nThis approach seems to accomplish several desirable goals:\n1) It allows us to define the term 'cell line' for the community in a precise way that also reflects how the term is most commonly used in the literature and scientific discourse.\n(2) It gives a definition that provides clear criteria to help specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world\n(3) The criteria it provides demarcate populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.\n(4) The definition seems to be true to the meaning of the word 'line' - which is suggests a specific lineage of derivation." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

<https://w3id.org/GConsent#Processing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Processing is defined by the GDPR (Article 4-2) as \"any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\".\n\nProcessing can be considered as the action, within an activity for example, that uses data in a particular or specific way. Therefore, processing specifies what is happening to/with the data. \n\nTo define a type of processing (or its associated action), the Processing class should be subclassed for each type. Furthermore, each subclass should define a instance as a generic representative of that action. For example, \"collect\" as a type of processing (defined by the GDPR), is defined as the class DataCollection, which is a subclass of Processing, and has the individual CollectionOfPersonalData to represent a generic instance of the concept. This is to provide a ready-to-use ontology in terms of \"collect\" as an action, while also providing a way to specialise the action/processing.\nGConsent defines several such types of processing taken from the text of the GDPR."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .

Examples are:\n- Languages\n- Species\n- Tools\n\nAn (instance of the) esco:FacetConceptGroup is a sub-set of concepts from a facet.\nEach esco:FacetConceptGroup is defined by the ESCO concept scheme http://data.europa.eu/esco/ConceptScheme/FacetConceptGroups.\nThe typical use of an esco:FacetConceptGroup is to specialize one or more ESCO pillar concepts. (see http://data.europa.eu/esco/model#facet).\nThe specialization creates narrower (or transitive narrower) concepts of the specialized ESCO pillar concept.\nEach specialization is a Faceted (or compound) concept (with type http://data.europa.eu/esco/model#FacetedConcept) having as component concepts:\n- the ESCO pillar object being specialized and\n- one member concept from the facet group.\n\nAn ESCO pillar concept is either an esco:SimpleConcept or an esco:FacetedConcept \n\nAn ESCO concept can be specialized in different ways using different Facet concept groups\n\nThe Facet concept group may be structured:\n- members of an esco:FacetConceptGroup can have hierarchical relationships (skos:broader and skos:narrower) among its member concepts.\n  If this is the case, the hierarchical structure among the specialized concepts constructed with this facet group will mirror the hierarchy of the facet group.\n  See also skos:topMember.\n- an esco:FacetConceptGroup can be an oredered collection.\n  In this case, the order among the spicialized concepts constructed with this facet group will mirror the order of the facet group.\n- an esco:FacetConceptGroup can have different sub-collections (i.e. have skos:member that are a skos:Collection and an iso-thes:ThesaurusArray).\n  Collections only serve to organize the constructed faceted concepts such that the faceted concepts\n  that are specializations based on the structured Facet concept group are organized by thesaurus arrays\n  that each mirror an original thesaurus array of the Facet concept group.\n\nExample: the language FacetConceptGroup can have as members\n- the (possibly ordered) collection of spoken languages\n  having as members the language concepts\n- the (possibly ordered) collection of sign languages\n  having as members the sign language concepts\n\nThe name of the facet group is given by skos:prefLabel"@en <http://data.europa.eu/esco/model> .
