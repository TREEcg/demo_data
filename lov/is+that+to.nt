<http://ns.inria.fr/ludo/v1/xapi#Activity> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An Activity is a type of Object making up the “this” in I did “this”; it is something with which an Actor interacted. It can be a unit of instruction, experience, or performance that is to be tracked in meaningful combination with a Verb. Interpretation of Activity is broad, meaning that Activities can even be tangible objects such as a chair (real or virtual). In the statement \"Anna tried a cake recipe\", the recipe constitutes the Activity in terms of the xAPI statement. Other examples of activities include a book, an e-learning course, a hike or a meeting."@en <http://ns.inria.fr/ludo/v1/xapi> .
