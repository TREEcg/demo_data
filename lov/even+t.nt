Its main purpose is to define the basic \"boundary\" operation that ties the primitives in each dimension together. A geometric primitive (GM_Primitive) is a geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. This includes curves and surfaces, even though they are composed of curve segments and surface patches, respectively. This composition is a strong aggregation: curve segments and surface patches cannot exist outside the context of a primitive.\nNOTE Most geometric primitives are decomposable infinitely many times. Adding a centre point to a line may split that line into two separate lines. A new curve drawn across a surface may divide that surface into two parts, each of which is a surface. This is the reason that the normal definition of primitive as \"non-decomposable\" is not plausible in a geometry model - the only non-decomposable object in geometry is a point.\nAny geometric object that is used to describe a feature is a collection of geometric primitives. A collection of geometric primitives may or may not be a geometric complex. Geometric complexes have additional properties such as closure by boundary operations and mutually exclusive component parts.\nGM_Primitive and GM_Complex share most semantics, in the meaning of operations, attributes and associations. There is an exception in that a GM_Primitive shall not contain its boundary (except in the trivial case of GM_Point where the boundary is empty), while a GM_Complex shall contain its boundary in all cases. This means that if an instantiated object implements GM_Object operations both as GM_Primitive and as a GM_Complex, the semantics of each set theoretic operation is determined by the its name resolution. Specifically, for a particular object such as GM_CompositeCurve, GM_Primitive::contains (returns FALSE for end points) is different from GM_Complex::contains (returns TRUE for end points). Further, if that object is cast as a GM_Primitive value and as a GM_Complex value, then the two values need not be equal as GM_Objects." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19107/2003/geometry> .

However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'simultaneous'.\nIt is important to note --- for all tense values, but in particular for the Present Tense --- that the 'times' which are used to locate the event, the deictic centre, and the reference point, may or may not be 'points' on the time line. Conventionally, these concepts are considered neutral with regard to whether they are points or intervals of time longer than a point. In a formal model of tense meanings they could, for example, be represented as sets (of points): in order to capture temporal distinctions, the notion of an event being 'simultaneous with the moment of speech', may be understood as (the set of) event time (points) and (the set of) speech time (points) having a non-empty intersection. Hence, this semantic model of the Present Tense value may include the interpretation of the present as 'universal' or 'generic'.\nThe simultaneous temporal relation may obtain either in 'simple' or 'perfect' contexts.

This alters the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. 'Perfect' temporal relations contrast with 'simple' temporal relations in which the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach 1947].\nThere are two types of 'perfect' context which may lead to separate tense values:\n(1) The first type occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and instead located after the event time. A common example occurs with an anterior temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time to the moment of speech. The event time is anterior to the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the event and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have read this book, I have seen John --- hence the interpretation that the event has an effect or is in some way still relevant at the moment of speech.

A common example occurs with a simultaneous temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time and located before the moment of speech. The event time is still simultaneous with the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the reference point and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have lived here [for ten years] --- hence the interpretation that the event which began in the past extends up to the moment of speech.

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/FutureTense> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A value of Tense Property assigned to the designated element in the clause when the meaning selected for the clause is that intended to locate the event spoken about as posterior to the deictic centre of the utterance. Most commonly, this tense meaning is referred to as 'future', because in absolute tense systems the deictic centre is the moment of speech. However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'posterior'. The posterior temporal relation may obtain either in 'simple' or 'perfect' contexts. Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach 1947], who suggested using a third point in time, 'reference point', to capture all possible tense distinctions. In all 'simple' temporal relations, the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. 'Perfect' tense meanings are created when the reference point is separated and moved away from the event time, thus altering the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. Posterior temporal relationships obtaining in a 'perfect' context occur when the reference point is moved away from the event time. There are various logical possibilities for locating the reference point with respect to the other two points, though none of them seem to be typically grammaticalised as separate tenses. Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Future Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the posterior temporal relationship, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings.

A collective agent can have roles that are also roles of those agents.\nFor example, in sociology, a 'group action' is the situation in which a number of people (that result to be members of a collective) in a given area behave in a coordinated way in order to achieve a (often common) goal. The Agent in such a Situation is not single, but a CollectiveAgent (a Group). This can be generalized to the notion of social movement, which assumes a large Community or even the entire Society as agents.\nThe difference between a CollectiveAgent and an Organization is that a Description that introduces a CollectiveAgent is also one that unifies the corresponding Collective. In practice, this difference makes collective agents 'less stable' than organizations, because they have a dedicated, publicly recognizable Description that is conceived to introduce them." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .
