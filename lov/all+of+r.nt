<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "At the conceptual level, the rdfs:Literal datatype fully represents the RADion datatypes of \n    a string (an untyped literal) and text (string plus language tag). The RADion datatype of \n    dateTime is also served since that requires a string conformant with ISO 8601:2004 which is \n    true of all relevant xsd datatypes. Likewise a Literal datatyped as xsd:anyURI will fulfil \n    the needs of RADion's URI data type."@en <http://www.w3.org/ns/radion#> .

It is designed to yield high modeling power and elasticity to cope with the huge variety in funding and project practices, which makes it applicable to many areas where funding is an important aspect: first of all research, but also the arts, cultural conservation, and many others." <https://w3id.org/dingo/> .
