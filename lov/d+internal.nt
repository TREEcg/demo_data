This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.\n\nExamples:\n- the capital of Italy (E53) is identified by \"Rome\" (E48)\n- text 25014-32 (E33) is identified by \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" (E35)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP1(x,y) ⊃ E1(x)\nP1(x,y) ⊃ E41(y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
