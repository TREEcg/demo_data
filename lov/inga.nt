These can be either normal game items purchased with in-game currency or with real world money. An example of vgo:GameProduct could be a consumable health potion bought with real money, a better weapon or some visual improvement (e.g. Hats in Steam). Basically a game product can be anything, a character, an item or an achievement.\nGameProduct is a subclass of Good Relations: ProductOrService & schema:Product. Since vgo:GameProduct is a type of buyable product, it reuses the properties available in the schema and Good Relations, such as currency price, validity of the offer and so on."@en <http://purl.org/net/VideoGameOntology> .
