<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PlusClick> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "PlusClick refers to having the properties of a click.  Clicks are stops in which the essential component is the rarefaction of air enclosed between two articulatory closures formed in the oral cavity, so that a loud transient is produced when the more forward closure is released.  This uses the velaric airstream mechanism, always ingressive, and cannot be used for sounds other than stops and affricates.
