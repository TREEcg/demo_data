Although the organization's name refers to memory cards, their standards are not limited to memory devices. These cards can be used for wireless connectivity, modem and other functions in laptop/notebook PCs that may be lacking them natively.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"PCMCIA\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCMCIA) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .
