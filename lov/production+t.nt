<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E80_Part_Removal> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises the activities that result in an instance of E18 Physical Thing being decreased by the removal of a part.\n\nTypical scenarios include the detachment of an accessory, the removal of a component or part of a composite object, or the deaccessioning of an object from a curated E78 Collection. If the E80 Part Removal results in the total decomposition of the original object into pieces, such that the whole ceases to exist, the activity should instead be modelled as an E81 Transformation, i.e. a simultaneous destruction and production. In cases where the part removed has no discernible identity prior to its removal but does have an identity subsequent to its removal, the activity should be regarded as both E80 Part Removal and E12 Production. This class of activities forms a basis for reasoning about the history, and continuity of identity over time, of objects that are removed from other objects, such as precious gemstones being extracted from different items of jewelry, or cultural artifacts being deaccessioned from different museum collections over their lifespan.\n\nExamples:\n- the removal of the engine from my car\n- the disposal of object number 1976:234 from the collection\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE80(x) ⊃ E11(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E12_Production> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises activities that are designed to, and succeed in, creating one or more new items.\n\nIt specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered \"new\" if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered \"new\" because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.\n\nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.\n\nAn event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen\n- Rembrandt's creating of the seventh state of his etching \"Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove\", 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12,E65,E81)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE12(x) ⊃ E11(x)\nE12(x) ⊃ E63(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. Moreover it expresses similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons.\n\n\nExamples:\n- the Parthenon Frieze on the Acropolis in Athens (E22) shows features of the Original Parthenon Frieze in the British museum (E22).
