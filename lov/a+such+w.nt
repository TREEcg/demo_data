It includes both informal and legally constituted organizations. Organizations can act as agents - to undertake projects, to enter into agreements, to own properties, etc. Most organizations have names. Almost all of them have at least two members."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .

Cloud area fraction is also called \"cloud amount\" and \"cloud cover\". The cloud area fraction is for the whole atmosphere column, as seen from the surface or the top of the atmosphere. The cloud area fraction in a layer of the atmosphere has the standard name cloud_area_fraction_in_atmosphere_layer. The ISCCP cloud area fraction is diagnosed from atmosphere model output by the ISCCP simulator software in such a way as to be comparable with the observational diagnostics of ISCCP (the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project)." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .

<http://harmonet.org/harmonise.rdfs#Accommodation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Accommodation aggregated concept is the primary accommodation entity. An accommodation is in one location and is managed by an organiser. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if an accommodation is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple accommodations.\nAn accommodation may consist of a hotel, or a bed and breakfast, or a pension, or any other form of accommodation which provides private-room, catered services to guests. The self-catering and camping sectors are excluded from the scope of the accommodation concept. However, the accommodation ontology is structured in such a way as to facilitate the broadening of the sub domain in the future. \n\nAn accommodation is made up of a number of units (often bedrooms). The accommodation has facilities which are available on a per-accommodation basis (accommodation-level facilities), such as a swimming pool or car park. The units also have facilities, which are available on a per-unit basis (unit-level facilities), such as hair-dryers." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .

For example the elementary charge e is a natural unit of electric charge, or the speed of light c is a natural unit of speed.</p>\r\n<p>A purely natural system of units is defined in such a way that some set of selected universal physical constants are normalized to unity; that is, their numerical values in terms of these units become exactly 1.</p>\r\n<p>Examples are Planck Units and Atomic Units. Atomic units (au or a.u.) form a system of natural units which is especially convenient for atomic physics calculations. There are two different kinds of atomic units, which one might name Hartree atomic units and Rydberg atomic units, which differ in the choice of the unit of mass and charge.</p>\r\n<p>Planck units are unique among systems of natural units, because they are not defined in terms of properties of any prototype, physical object, or even elementary particle.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
