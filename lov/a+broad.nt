Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, etc.), computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors, multicolor LED displays, and large screens as JumboTron, etc. Color printers, on the other hand, are usually not RGB devices, but subtractive color devices (typically CMYK color model).\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"RGB\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#expresses> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This is a large comment field for those who want to investigate the different uses of the 'expresses' relation for modeling different approaches to meaning characterization and modeling.\nFor example, in all these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:\n\n- Beehive means \"a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box.\" (Oxford dictionary)\n- 'Beehive' is a synonym in noun synset 09218159 \"beehive|hive\" (WordNet)\n- 'the term Beehive can be interpreted as the fact of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.'\n- 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas'\n- 'the term Beehive expresses the concept Beehive'\n- ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the same meaning as for, say, fishermen'\n- 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to fit mine'\n- ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives'\n- 'from the term 'Beehive', we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it'\n- the lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame 'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet)\n\nAs the examples suggest, the 'meaning of meaning' is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up formalizing. \nHowever, the usefulness of having a 'semantic abstraction' in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. \nWe provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the 'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.\n\nIn the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). \nAnother approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'.\nStill another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. \nA radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a community use that object.\nAnother approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within texts) in which that object is used similarly.\nThe logical approach to meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. \nFinally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive):\n\n(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference)\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Cognitive meaning (as for 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive system, or neural system of an agent)\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for 'social science' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.)\n\t- Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector space)\n\n(2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between 'expresses' and 'isAbout', which can be used interchangeably)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld\n\nThis is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning. A more developed ontology should approach the problem of integrating the different uses of 'expresses', so that different theories, resources, methods can interoperate." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

L'ontologie permet de représenter : 1) La hiérarchie d'une société : Groupe (Entreprise), Divisions d'un groupe, Marques d'une division ou d'un groupe, 2) La production d'une société : Gammes de produits (attachées à une marque), produits d'une gamme, packages de produits (un panier alimentaire par exemple), composition des produits...\n\nQuels apports ? \n\n- pv:Range\nDans ProVoc, nous introduisons les gammes de produits pv:Range.\nGoodRelations défini des variantes de produits  (http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/Product_variants, http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html#isVariantOf) : \"A variant is a specialization of a product model and inherits all of its product properties, unless they are defined locally. This allows a very compact modeling of product models that vary only in  a few properties.\"\nD'après GoodRelations, une variante d'un MacBook est par exemple un MacBook13Inch ou un MacBook15Inch qui varient par leur taille d'écran  et la quantité de ports USB disponibles. Il s'agit d'héritage entre un produit « parent » et ses dérivés qui doivent respecter les normes imposées par le produit « parent » (à moins de redéfinir les valeurs). Dans la version actuelle de GoodRelations, il existe une relation gr:isVariantOf nécessairement entre deux modèles de produits ou service. Or, les gammes de produits peuvent difficilement être traitées comme un ensemble de dérivés d'un produit/modèle commun. Par exemple, Elsève est une gamme proposant des shampooings avec des dérivés, mais Elsève propose aussi des Colorations avec des dérivés,  des Huiles avec des dérivés etc etc, donc à part qu'il s'agit de traitement pour les cheveux, ces  produits n'ont pas grand-chose en commun. En utilisant gr:isVariantOf entre certains produits « proches », on aurait plusieurs clusters de produits apparentés, au détriment d'une gamme unique. L'utilisation de pv:Range permet de respecter la structure fournie par l'expert, non subjective.\nEn conclusion, les variantes semblent pertinentes pour identifier des produits similaires (voir également http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo qui ne se différencie de isVariantOf que par le fait que le domain et le range de isSimilarTo sont plus large), mais les gammes de produits ont une toute autre vocation.\ngr:isVariantOf a une sémantique très large et subjective (comme pour isSimilarTo, d’ailleurs M. Hepp le dit clairement ici http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo). Par exemple, rien n’empêche d’exprimer qu’une Renault Clio 4 est une variante d’une Ford Fiesta (http://www.autonews.fr/nouveautes/nouveaute/104216-renault-clio-fiesta-prix/ pourtant elles ne sont pas de la même marque.  \nEnfin, notons qu'une pv:Range ne représente ni un produit ni un modèle de produit. pv:Range permet de lier une marque à ses produits de façon non subjective (fournie par l’expert). \nIl serait pertinent de limiter l’utilisation de gr:isVariantOf aux produits appartenant à une pv:Range.\n\n- pv:Package\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons la classe pv:Package qui permet de représenter des ensembles de produits vendus comme un unique produit. Par exemple un coffret de cosmétique contenant une BB crème, un gloss, et le parfum La vie est Belle de Lancôme. Un autre exemple est un panier alimentaire contenant différents produits.\n\n- pv:Provider\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons pv:Provider qui représente les fournisseurs de produits (par exemple Carrefour est fournisseur des produits Nutella).\n\n- pv:Component\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons pv:Component qui permet de décrire la composiiton d'un produit (par exemple, un parfum peut contenir du linalool).\n\nD'autres classes et propriétés sont introduites dans ProVoc dans le but de raffiner le modèle. Par exemple, pv:Model, pv:Designer, et pv:Ambassador sont des sous-classes de foaf:Person. ProVoc permet aussi de lier les composants d'un produit avec leur impact sur la santé (pv:healthImpact).\n\nConcernant les propriétés classiques liées directement au produit, telles que la couleur, le prix, la référence, la description, etc, voir Good Relations.\n"@fr <http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> .

This ontology reflects: 1) The basic hierarchy of a company: Group (Company), Divisions of a Group, Brand names attached to a Division or a Group, and 2) The production of a company: products, ranges of products (attached to a Brand), the composition of a product, packages of products...\n\n\nWhat contributions ? \n\n- pv:Range\nIn ProVoc we introduce pv:Range.\nGoodRelations defined \"variants\" ( http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/Product_variants , http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html#isVariantOf ) as following: \"\"A variant is a specialization of a product model and inherits all of its product properties, unless they are defined locally. This allows a very compact modeling of product models that vary only in  a few properties. \"\nAccording to GoodRelations, a variant of a MacBook is for example a MacBook13Inch or MacBook15Inch which vary in screen size and in available USB ports. This is inheritage between a product model and its derivatives, which must meet the standards imposed by the product model (obviously values can be redefined locally). According to the current version of GoodRelations,gr:isVariantOf necessarily exists between two models of product or service. However, ranges of products can hardly be considered as a set of derivatives of a product (or model of product). For example, Elsève is a range of products offering shampoos with some derivatives, but Elsève also offers creams with derivatives, oils with derivatives etc., so apart that such products are related to treatment for hair, they have not much in common. Using gr:isVariantOf between certain 'close' products, we would obtain multiple clusters of related products, to the detriment of a unique range of products. Using pv:Range allows to respect the structure provided by the expert.\nIn conclusion, variants seem to identify similar products (see also http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo which differs from gr:isVariantOf by the fact that the domain and ranks of isSimilarTo are larger), but pv:range has a different vocation.\ngr:isVariantOf has a very broad and subjective semantics (such as gr:isSimilarTo, as Mr. Hepp said clearly here http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo ). For example , with gr:isVariantOf it would be possible to express that a Renault Clio 4 is a variant of a Ford Fiesta ( http://www.autonews.fr/nouveautes/nouveaute/104216-renault-clio-fiesta-prix/ yet they are not of the same brand) whilst they are not of the same brand name.\nFinally, note that a pv:Range does not represent a set of products nor product models. pv:range is used to objectively link a brand to its products (provided by the expert).\nIt would be appropriate to limit the use of gr:isVariantOf to products belonging to a pv:Range.\n\n- pv:Package\nIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Package class that is used to represent sets of products sold as a single product. For example a cosmetic box containing a BB cream, a lip gloss, and a perfume byl Lancôme. Another example is a food package that contains different products.\n\n- pv:Provider\nIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Provider that makes a product available in the e-commerce.\n\n- pv:Component\nIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Component which enables to describe the composition of a product (for instance, a perfume can contain linalool).\n\nWe  introduce more properties and classes in order to refine the model. For instance, pv:Model, pv:Designer, and pv:Ambassador appear as a subclass of foaf:Person.  ProVoc can also be used in order to link products and their components with their impact on health ( see pv:healthImpact).\n\nConcerning classic properties related to the product, such as color, price, reference, description, etc., see Good Relations (http://www.heppnetz.de/projects/goodrelations/).\n"@en <http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> .
