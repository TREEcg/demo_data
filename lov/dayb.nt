Genre\n      terms for textual materials designate specific kinds of materials distinguished by the style\n      or technique of their intellectual contents; for example, biographies, catechisms, essays,\n      hymns, or reviews. Form terms designate historically and functionally specific kinds of\n      materials as distinguished by an examination of their physical character, characteristics of\n      their intellectual content, or the order of information within them; for example, daybooks,\n      diaries, directories, journals, memoranda, questionnaires, syllabi, or time sheets. In the\n      context of graphic materials, genre headings denote categories of material distinguished by\n      vantage point, intended purpose, characteristics of the creator, publication status, or method\n      of representation."@en <http://www.loc.gov/mads/rdf/v1> .
