<http://purl.org/pav/hasEarlierVersion> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This versioned resource has an earlier version.\n\nAny earlier version of this resource can be indicated with pav:hasEarlierVersion, e.g.:\n\n<http://example.com/v4> pav:hasEarlierVersion <http://example.com/v2> ;\n    pav:hasEarlierVersion <http://example.com/v1> .\n\n\nThe subproperty pav:previousVersion SHOULD be used if the earlier version is the direct ancestor of this version.\n\n<http://example.com/v4> pav:previousVersion <http://example.com/v3> .\n\n\nThis property is transitive, so it should not be necessary to repeat the earlier versions of an earlier version. A chain of previous versions can be declared using the subproperty pav:previousVersion, implying that the previous previous version is also an earlier version. It might however still be useful to declare an earlier version explicitly, for instance because it is an earlier version of high relevance or because the complete chain of pav:previousVersion is not available.\n\n\nTo indicate that this version is a snapshot of a more general, non-versioned resource, e.g. \"Weather Today\" vs. \"Weather Today on 2013-12-07\", see pav:hasVersion." <http://purl.org/pav/> .

Typically for a journal article, the Definitive Version results from revision of an earlier submitted version of the work following peer review, and is then published in print and/or digital form after the publisher has assigned it a DOI.  The Definitive Version is also known as the Version of Record, although according to the CrossRef Glossary (http://crossref.org/02publishers/glossary.html) that term can also refer to the author's final version of a work that is not formally published.
