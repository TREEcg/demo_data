<http://umbel.org/umbel#correspondsTo> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The property umbel:correspondsTo is used to assert a close correspondence between an external class, named entity, individual or instance with a Reference Concept class. umbel:correspondsTo relates the external class, named entity, individual or instance to the class through the basis of both its subject matter and intended scope. This predicate should be used where the correspondence between the two entities is felt to be nearly equivalent to a sameAs assertion, and is reflexive, but without the full entailments of intensional class memberships. In these cases, both entities are understood to have the same type and intended scope, but without asserting a full class-level or sameAs individual relationship.\n\nThis predicate is designed for the circumstance of aligning two different ontologies or knowledge bases based on node-level correspondences, but without entailing the actual ontological relationships and structure of the object source. For example, the umbel:correspondsTo predicate is used to assert close correspondence between UMBEL Reference Concepts and Wikipedia categories or pages, yet without entailing the actual Wikipedia category structure.\n\nThis property asserts a different and stronger relationship than umbel:isAbout. One practical use is to guide specific instance member determinations when, say, the native structure of the external ontology or knowledge base is to be analyzed and replaced with an UMBEL-based structure.\n\nThis property is therefore used to create a nearly equivalent assertion (however, with the degree of that equivalence being unknown or unknowable) between an external instance or class and a Reference Concept class"@en <http://umbel.org/umbel> .

An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\n\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\n\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as \"preferred identifier assignment\", to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.\n\nExamples:\n- Replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- Assigning the author-uniform title heading \"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832. Faust. 1. Theil.\" for a work (E28)\n- On June 1, 2001 assigning the personal name heading \"Guillaume, de Machaut, ca. 1300-1377\" (E42,E82) to Guillaume de Machaut (E21)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE15(x) âŠƒ E13(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://harmonet.org/harmonise.rdfs#Accommodation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Accommodation aggregated concept is the primary accommodation entity. An accommodation is in one location and is managed by an organiser. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if an accommodation is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple accommodations.\nAn accommodation may consist of a hotel, or a bed and breakfast, or a pension, or any other form of accommodation which provides private-room, catered services to guests. The self-catering and camping sectors are excluded from the scope of the accommodation concept. However, the accommodation ontology is structured in such a way as to facilitate the broadening of the sub domain in the future. \n\nAn accommodation is made up of a number of units (often bedrooms). The accommodation has facilities which are available on a per-accommodation basis (accommodation-level facilities), such as a swimming pool or car park. The units also have facilities, which are available on a per-unit basis (unit-level facilities), such as hair-dryers." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .
