The laboratory notebook serves as an organizational tool and a memory aid.  It may also have a role in recording and protecting any intellectual property created during the research, and may be used in evidence when establishing priority of discoveries, for example in patent applications.

The WorkflowRun is also a ProcessRun, and so the overall inputs and outputs of thw workflow execution can be described in the same manner.\n\nThese provenance details are linked to the corresponding wfdesc descriptions using wfdesc:describedbyProcess, wfdesc:describedByWorkflow and wfdesc:describedByParameter.\n\n\nThis ontology can be further linked to more specific provenance ontologies like OPM-V or W3C PROV-O, but this should be done separately."@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfprov> .
