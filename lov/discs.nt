S. Bach's Six suites for unaccompanied cello\n\n    * Expression #1 sound issued during the performance by Janos Starker recorded in 1963 and 1965\n          o Manifestation #1 recordings released on 33 1/3 rpm sound discs in 1965 by Mercury\n          o Manifestation #2 recordings re-released on compact disc in 1991 by Mercury \n    * Expression #2 sound issued during the performances by Yo-Yo Ma recorded in 1983\n          o Manifestation #1 recordings released on 33 1/3 rpm sound discs in 1983 by CBS Records\n          o Manifestation #2 recordings re-released on compact disc in 1992 by CBS Records \n\n          \nChanges that occur deliberately or even inadvertently in the production process that affect the copies result, strictly speaking, in a new manifestation. A manifestation resulting from such a change may be identified as a particular \"state\" or \"issue\" of the publication.\n\nChanges that occur to an individual copy after the production process is complete (e.g., the loss of a page, rebinding, etc.) are not considered to result in a new manifestation. That copy is simply considered to be an exemplar (or item) of the manifestation that deviates from the copy as produced.\n\nWith the entity defined as manifestation we can describe the physical characteristics of a set of items and the characteristics associated with the production and distribution of that set of items that may be important factors in enabling users to choose a manifestation appropriate to their physical needs and constraints, and to identify and acquire a copy of that manifestation.\n\nDefining manifestation as an entity also enables us to draw relationships between specific manifestations of a work. We can use the relationships between manifestations to identify, for example, the specific publication that was used to create a microreproduction.          \n\n" <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .

This is normally an single object (a CD) possessed by somebody.\n\nFrom the FRBR final report: The entity defined as item is a concrete entity. It is in many instances a single physical object (e.g., a copy of a one-volume monograph, a single audio cassette, etc.). There are instances, however, where the entity defined as item comprises more than one physical object (e.g., a monograph issued as two separately bound volumes, a recording issued on three separate compact discs, etc.).\n\nIn terms of intellectual content and physical form, an item exemplifying a manifestation is normally the same as the manifestation itself. However, variations may occur from one item to another, even when the items exemplify the same manifestation, where those variations are the result of actions external to the intent of the producer of the manifestation (e.g., damage occurring after the item was produced, binding performed by a library, etc.). \n    " <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .
