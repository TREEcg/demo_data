<http://www.purl.org/drammar#UnderspecifiedPlan> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An UnderspecifiedPlan is a plan that is part of a larger plan to achieve some\n            goal, but has not been executed. In drama, it represents the unobservable part of a plan\n            that has not been fully carried out by some agent. Its existence (in the agent's\n            mind) can only be conjectured - remember that a Plan is intended by some agent by\n            definition. As the object of a conjecture, it does not contain any details in the\n            representation of drama (this does not mean that it does not contain them in the\n            agent's mind). As such, an UnderspecifiedPlan: - does *not* motivate a timeline (it\n            has not taken place); - does *not* achieve a goal (the actions/subplans composing it and\n            its specific goal are not known); - does *not* contain any actions. These conditions,\n            part of its definition as an Equivalent Class, distinguish it from Abstract and Directly\n            Executable Plans." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
