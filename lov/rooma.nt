A Value can e.g. be observed or influenced by devices, or it constitutes static data about a Thing.\nE.g. the indoor temperature of the room could be a Value of a Thing \"room\".\nA Value of a thing can concern a certain Aspect, e.g. the indoor temperature concerns the Aspect \"Temperature\" that could be measured by a temperature sensor.\nA Value of a Thing can have meta data" <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .

However, the sub-class of Thing that is able to interact electronically is called a \"Device\".\nA Thing may have ThingProperties (Object Property: hasThingProperty). A Thing can have relations to other things (Object Property: hasThingRelation).\nSince a Thing that is not a Device is not able to conmmunicate electronically it cannot influence the value of its ThingProperties or being influenced by it. Similarly a Thing cannot document its - real-world - relationships (via hasThingRelation) to other Things.\n\nE.g. A room that is modelled in oneM2M would be a Thing that could have a room-temperature as a ThingProperty and could have a relationship \"isAdjacentTo\" to another room" <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .
