Depicting is meant in the sense that the surface of the E24 Physical Man-Made Thing shows, through its passive optical qualities or form, a representation of the entity depicted. It does not pertain to inscriptions or any other information encoding.\n\nThis property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1CRM Entity. P62.1 mode of depiction allows the nature of the depiction to be refined.\n\nExamples:\n- The painting \"La Liberté guidant le peuple\" by Eugène Delacroix (E84) depicts the French \"July Revolution\" of 1830 (E7)\n- the 20 pence coin held by the Department of Coins and Medals of the British Museum under registration number 2006,1101.126 (E24) depicts Queen Elizabeth II (E21) mode of depiction Profile (E55)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP62(x,y) ⊃ E24(x)\nP62(x,y) ⊃ E1(y)\nP62(x,y,z) ⊃ [P62(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\n\nProperties: P62.1 mode of depiction: E55 Type"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.\n\nThe class E36 Visual Item provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks or images etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Man-Made Thing and depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a short-cut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.\n\nExamples:\n- the visual appearance of Monet's \"La Pie\" (E38)\n- the Coca-Cola logo (E34)\n- the Chi-Rho (E37)\n- the communist red star (E37)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE36(x) ⊃ E73(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
