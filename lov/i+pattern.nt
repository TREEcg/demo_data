<http://www.purl.org/drammar#SituationSchema> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The situation schema provides the pattern for the description of incidents and states. It is inspired by the Situation ontology Pattern of the Ontology Design Pattern initiative (http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/). So, a SituationSchema describes (\"describes\" object property) a DramaPerdurant (either a State or a Process).\nThe schema works as a hub for the roles involved in a situation. The property hasRole links the Situation class (its domain) with the Role class (the range of the property). Also, notice that, as illustrated in the documentation of the SituationSchema class, a Situation Schema (or, better, its subclasses) does not directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge employed to describe drama: rather, it refers to the ExternalRefSchema class (subclass of the top level ExternalReference class), which in  turn refers to the linguistic knowledge. The SituationSchema class specializes into specific schemata for describing specific type of situations: \n- FrameNetSchema: for describing processes, like giving or killing (in Drammar, they are grouped into units arranged on timelines), and states, like being behind some object or being dead (in Drammar, they are bundled into sets that border timelines and plans). \n- MentalStateSchema: this class groups the specific types of schemata for describing the mental states of the agents in Drammar, namely beliefs, goals, emotions and values. \nTechnically, the subtypes of SituationSchema are characterized by different values of the quale_schemaType data property: \"belief\", \"emotion\", \"framenet\", \"goal\",  \"value\". \nFinally, it is worth mentioning that is a specific design choice of Drammar not to represent the nesting of states: only the type of the top level state, e.g., a belief, is represented, independent of what that belief contains in turn. This flat style of representation is determined by the decision not to commit to a specific logical account of state types. When Drammar is employed for annotation, the content nested into a state is described informally in natural language description accompanying the state, if needed. \nRefs: Gangemi, A., & Presutti, V.
