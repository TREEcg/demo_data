Examples of such services may include calendar, addressbook and mailbox managed by a PIM application. This category is introduced to distinguish between data available directly from the applications (Via some Interprocess Communication Mechanisms) and data available from files on a disk. In either case both DataObjects would receive a similar interpretation (e.g. a Mailbox) and wouldn't differ on the content level." <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo> .

Note that any E18 Physical Thing may carry information, such as an E34 Inscription. However, unless it was specifically designed for this purpose, it is not an Information Carrier. Therefore the property P128 carries (is carried by) applies to E18 Physical Thing in general.\n\nExamples:\n- the Rosetta Stone\n- my paperback copy of Crime & Punishment\n- the computer disk at ICS-FORTH that stores the canonical Definition of the CIDOC CRM\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE84(x) âŠƒ E22(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
