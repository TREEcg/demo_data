<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E92_Spacetime_Volume> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises 4 dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime regardless its true geometric form. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, Place and Timespan are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of a spacetime volume is trivially its projection on time.\n\nExamples:\n- the spacetime Volume of the Event of Ceasars murder \n- the spacetime Volume where and when the carbon 14 dating of the \"Schoeninger Speer II\" in 1996  took place \n- the spatio‐temporal trajectory of the H.M.S. Victory from its building to its actual location\n- the spacetime volume defined by a polygon approximating the Danube river flood in Austria between 6th and 9th of August 2002\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE92(x) ⊃ E1(x)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
