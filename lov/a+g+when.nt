The default is 0 that means that when a graph fails to load it is removed from the knowledge base. If the value of this attribute is, for instance 3, this means that the Graph will be keept in the knowledge base untill its loading fails for three consecutive  times (the fourth error drives a graph drop). A succesfull loading reset the fail counter.N.B. a \"not modified\" message does not reset the fail counter."@en <http://linkeddata.center/kees/v1> .

Also known as earth station, or earth terminal, it is a terrestrial radio station designed for extraplanetary telecommunication with spacecraft (constituting part of the ground segment of the spacecraft system), or reception of radio waves from astronomical radio sources. Ground stations may be located either on the surface of the Earth, or in its atmosphere.[1] Earth stations communicate with spacecraft by transmitting and receiving radio waves in the super high frequency or extremely high frequency bands (e.g., microwaves). When a ground station successfully transmits radio waves to a spacecraft (or vice versa), it establishes a telecommunications link. A principal telecommunications device of the ground station is the parabolic antenna." <http://purl.org/toco/> .
