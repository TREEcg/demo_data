(see http://data.europa.eu/esco/model#facet).\nThe specialization creates narrower (or transitive narrower) concepts of the specialized ESCO pillar concept.\nEach specialization is a Faceted (or compound) concept (with type http://data.europa.eu/esco/model#FacetedConcept) having as component concepts:\n- the ESCO pillar object being specialized and\n- one member concept from the facet group.\n\nAn ESCO pillar concept is either an esco:SimpleConcept or an esco:FacetedConcept \n\nAn ESCO concept can be specialized in different ways using different Facet concept groups\n\nThe Facet concept group may be structured:\n- members of an esco:FacetConceptGroup can have hierarchical relationships (skos:broader and skos:narrower) among its member concepts.\n  If this is the case, the hierarchical structure among the specialized concepts constructed with this facet group will mirror the hierarchy of the facet group.\n  See also skos:topMember.\n- an esco:FacetConceptGroup can be an oredered collection.\n  In this case, the order among the spicialized concepts constructed with this facet group will mirror the order of the facet group.\n- an esco:FacetConceptGroup can have different sub-collections (i.e. have skos:member that are a skos:Collection and an iso-thes:ThesaurusArray).\n  Collections only serve to organize the constructed faceted concepts such that the faceted concepts\n  that are specializations based on the structured Facet concept group are organized by thesaurus arrays\n  that each mirror an original thesaurus array of the Facet concept group.\n\nExample: the language FacetConceptGroup can have as members\n- the (possibly ordered) collection of spoken languages\n  having as members the language concepts\n- the (possibly ordered) collection of sign languages\n  having as members the sign language concepts\n\nThe name of the facet group is given by skos:prefLabel"@en <http://data.europa.eu/esco/model> .
