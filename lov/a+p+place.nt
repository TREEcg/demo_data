If the E53 Place is identified by a Section Definition, a more detailed representation can make use of the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path from E18 Physical Thing through P58 has section definition (defines section), E46 Section Definition, P87 is identified by (identifies) to E53 Place. A Place can only be located on or within one Physical Object.\n\nExamples:\n- HMS Victory (E22) has section HMS Victory section B347.6 (E53)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP59(x,y) ⊃ E18(x)\nP59(x,y) ⊃ E53(y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
