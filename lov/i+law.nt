<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Design> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Description of the Situation, in terms of structure and function, held by an Entity for some reason.\nA design is usually accompanied by the rationales behind the construction of the designed Entity (i.e. of the reasons why a design is claimed to be as such). For example, the actual design (a Situation) of a car or of a law is based on both the specification (a Description) of the structure, and the rationales used to construct cars or laws.\nWhile designs typically describe entities to be constructed, they can also be used to describe 'refunctionalized' entities, or to hypothesize unknown functions. For example, a cradle can be refunctionalized as a flowerpot based on a certain home design." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/Unit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A unit of measure is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law. It is used as a standard for measurement of the same quantity, where any other value of the quantity can be expressed as a simple multiple of the unit. For example, length is a quantity; the metre is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10 metre (or 10 m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called \"metre\"."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .
