<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Grapheme> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Crystal defines a grapheme as the minimal contrastive unit in the writing system of a language; usually enclosed in angle brackets. The grapheme <a>, for example, is realized as several allographs A, a, a, etc., which may be seen as units in complementary distribution (e.g. upper case restricted to sentence-initial position, proper names, etc.), or in free variation (as in some styles of handwriting), just as in phonemic analysis. 'Grapheme Analysis' is the main business of graphemics (or graphology). [Crystal 2008: 220]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .

A grapheme is an abstraction over a set of like glyphs, the actual images on the  page. That is, a particular grapheme is realized by particular glyphs. More than one glyph can realize the same grapheme. For instance, the letter A  and its cursive equivalent are each realizations of the grapheme Latin Capital Letter A."@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
