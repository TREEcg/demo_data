<http://www.w3.org/ns/regorg#registration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The legal status of a registered organization is conferred on it by an authority within a given \n      jurisdiction. The registration is therefore a fundamental relationship between a the organization and the authority with \n      which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the Identifier class which is \n      defined by ADMS. The vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's \n      identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain and elsewhere.\n      Although there is no formal cardinality constraint on any property in the Registered Organization Vocabulary, it is \n      questionable whether a description of a registered organization without this property and an associated Identifier class will \n      be of any value."@en <http://purl.org/oslo/ns/localgov> .
