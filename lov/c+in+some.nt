A gastro is in one location and is managed by one organisation. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if a gastro is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple gastros. Also, if a single establishment includes two different offerings (e.g. a bar, with basic bar food, and a restaurant with a la carte gourmet offerings), this is treated as two gastros, which are related to one another.\nA gastro may consist of a restaurant, a pub, a mountain hut, a sandwich shop, or any other form of location which provides prepared food or drink for consumption on or off the premises. \n\nA gastro has much in common with an accommodation, such as a location, an organiser, etc. However, it also has many attributes of its own, particularly those which focus on the food and drink available in the gastro. \n\nThe key attributes of a gastro, which differ from those of an accommodation are \n-\tThe gastroType of the gastro \n-\tThe cuisine served (which may be primarily drink, in some cases)\n-\tThe profile values (e.g. whether or not outside catering is provided, whether picnics are allowed, etc.)\n-\tThe facility values (e.g. whether there are separate children’s dining areas, whether there is a smoking room, etc.)\nThe profile and facility values are considered as extensions to the existing (accommodation) profile and facility values." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .

<https://w3id.org/GConsent#MinorDataSubject> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Minor is a Data Subject who cannot provide their own consent (that is legally valid). Therefore, their consent must be obtained via a Guardian or Legal Representative or Parent. Minor is a subclass of Data Subject.\n\nConsent given in lieu of a Minor (by their Representative) is associated with the `ConsentInstance` class/instance using the `wasGivenBy` property.\n\nThe ontology currently does not capture this relationship between the Minor and their Representative. This is due to required clarifications regarding how this role should be represented. For example, the `DataSubject` cannot be subclassed to create a `Representative` class, as this would make the `DataSubject` a permanent representative for the Minor. Instead, the role of 'acting as representative' is only for the instance of the given consent. Therefore, this could be represented with a `ConsentRepresentativeRole` class that links to the `MinorDataSubject` with `roleHadDataSubject` property, and the `DataSubject` that gave the consent via the `roleHadRepresentative` property. The relationship or reason or situation of this given consent can be captured by further annotating the `ConsentRepresentativeRole` instance. This approach can also be extended to other similar situations where one `DataSubject` gives consent in lieu of another.\n\nNote: A Minor can provide their own consent in certain cases, or conversely, a minor's consent may need to be provided by a 'parental' representative in some cases."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .

WGS84 geo positioning vocabulary.\n - The saref:DeviceCategory and saref:FunctionCategory classes have been removed. Instead, the hierarchy of device categories has been implemented directly as subclasses of the saref:Device class.\n - The information specific for energy efficiency has been moved to the SAREF4ENER extension. For example, the saref:Profile class has been redefined to accommodate only the properties that are general enough for any type of profile, not only for energy and power. Details on how to specifically model a power profile can be found in the SAREF4ENER extension. \n - The subclasses of the saref:Energy class  have been removed (i.e., Average Energy, Maximum Energy, Minimum Energy, Total Energy, HVAC Energy, Hot Water Energy and Lighting Energy).\n - The saref:Property class has been split into two classes (saref:Property and saref:Measurement), as it is done in the SAREF4ENVI extension, in order to properly accommodate the distinction between the concept of property (an observable quality of something) and the concept of measurement (a concrete value observed for a property).\n - Too restrictive cardinality restrictions have been revised, sometimes making them optional rather than mandatory (better to make properties mandatory in the extensions that specialize SAREF for a specific purpose, rather than restricting SAREF, whose purpose is more general). For example, definitions of units of measurement using an enumeration (owl:oneOf) were too restrictive because they did not allow using other units than those enumerated. Therefore, the individuals of each class are still there, but the owl:oneOf enumeration has been removed.\n - The saref:UnitOfMeasure subclasses use individuals from the OM ontology for unit of measures, but this is not the only solution. It has been clarified in the comments that the OM ontology is an example, but other ontologies can be used.\n - The global restrictions (rdfs:domain and rdfs:range) in object properties have been completely removed not to hinder interoperability. Object properties are now only restricted locally in the classes. \n - The subclasses of saref:Task have been transormed in individuals.\n - The saref:hasTask property has been removed from the saref:Profile class to resolve an ambiguity with the saref:Task class." <https://saref.etsi.org/core/> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DramaEndurant> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DramaEndurant is an entity of drama that can be described as an endurant\n            following Gangemi et al. 2002. In Gangemi et al. 2002 \"Endurants are wholly present\n            (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present\",\n            differently from perdurants, which are only partially present at any time they are\n            present. Endurants (and Perdurants, in some cases) play a role in processes and states:\n            an Endurant is connected to a role (Role class) in the description of a given process or\n            state by the hasRole object property. The class of drama endurants encompasses more\n            specific drama entities such as Agent and Object. This bipartite distinction is derived\n            from the drama literature, where - Agents that intentionally perform actions; - Objects\n            are involved in the actions in an unintentional way. For instance, in Hamlet, the King\n            of England is a drama endurant (but non an agent) because it is the filler of a role in\n            Claudius' actions (sending ... ) but does not intend any plan (a feature would\n            locate it in the Agent class). The difference beteween the King of England and a coffee\n            machine is entrusted to common sense knowlegde (e.g., the external lexical knowledge\n            stating the sementic type of these two entities).
