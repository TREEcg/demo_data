<http://purl.org/spar/pso/green-open-access> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The status of a published work made available by the author, by self-archiving a version of the work for free and open public use in their institutional repository, in a central repository, or elsewhere, in parallel with publication of a subscription-access Version of Record of the work by a publisher.  The green open-access version of the work may be a preprint (the version of the article as first submitted for publication) or a postprint (the pre-publication version of the article after incorporation of authors’ responses to peer reviewers’ comments).  Its availability may have an embargo restriction imposed by the publisher of the subscription-access version of the work, that prevents the green open-access version from being freely available until some substantial time after publication of the subscription-access journal issue containing that article.  A green open-access work should be accompanied by a license explicitly defining usage rights, for example a Creative Commons Attribution License.
