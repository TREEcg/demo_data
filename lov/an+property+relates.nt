La relazione tra il ruolo e l'ente che lo riveste è espressa nel nome della proprietà, che quindi ne fornisce una rappresentazione semplificata, con ridotta espressività. Nell'ontologia questa relazione è modellata anche, in maniera più espressiva, dalla classe AgentRole, che permette di collegare l'ente e il suo ruolo."@it <https://w3id.org/arco/ontology/arco> .
