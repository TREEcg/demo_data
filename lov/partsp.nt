What constitutes a part or component depends on the context and requirements of the documentation. Normally, the parts documented in this way would not be considered as worthy of individual attention.\n\nFor a more complete description, objects may be decomposed into their components and constituents using P46 is composed of (forms parts of) and P45 consists of (is incorporated in). This allows each element to be described individually.\n\nExamples:\n- chess set 233 (E22) has number of parts 33 (E60)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP57(x,y) ⊃ E19(x)\nP57(x,y) ⊃ E60(y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
