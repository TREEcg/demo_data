<http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo#NaiveBayes> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n\nNaive Bayes has been studied extensively since the 1950s. It was introduced under a different name into the text retrieval community in the early 1960s:488 and remains a popular (baseline) method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features. With appropriate preprocessing, it is competitive in this domain with more advanced methods including support vector machines.It also finds application in automatic medical diagnosis.\n\nNaive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.\n\nIn the statistics and computer science literature, Naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes.[4] All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method Russell and Norvig note that \"[naive Bayes] is sometimes called a Bayesian classifier, a somewhat careless usage that has prompted true Bayesians to call it the idiot Bayes model."@en <http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo> .

Process is\n            the class that bridges to the concept of Process in upper ontologies, externally to\n            Drammar (like DOLCE, where States and Processes are types of Statives: here, we include\n            also the event types called accomplishments and achievements in DOLCE). Consider that\n            such resources are not of linguistic type. The DescriptionTemplate class (or, better,\n            its subclass FrameNetSchema), in fact, drives the behavior of the process inside a Plan\n            or a Unit, linking it (via the ExternalReference Class) to: 1. a Wordnet sense 2. a\n            Frame (from Framenet or Verbnet) 3. a set of Roles, played by roles encompassed in the\n            frame All these links are bridged by the ExternalReference Class, which has\n            \"quale\" properties that link the reference to specific resources. In the\n            external ontology, a process may be logically defined through the use of axioms: for\n            example, in the action of asking, it is assumed that Speaker and Addressee are connected\n            through some communication medium, e.g. co-presence in a room or a telephone. In\n            Drammar, the DramaStructures that contain the Processes are Units (subclasses of\n            DramaSets) and Plans (subclasses of DramaLists). They are then subdivided through a\n            further trait, that is whether the process is intentional (of an agent) or not (Action\n            or UnintentionalProcess). This trait is defined through a specific Datatype property, of\n            boolean type, called isIntentional. So, its subclasses are: - Action: with isIntentional\n            property valued TRUE; - UnintentionalProcess: with isIntentional property valued FALSE.\n            Same happens in parallel to the States, although in that case the trait concerns the\n            state schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/RatioScale> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has \"twice the length\" of another (= is \"twice as long\"). Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying \"how much\" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or \"how many\" (a count). The Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
