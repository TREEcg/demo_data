In the first version of the SSN ontology, this concept was defined as a subproperty of dul:hasQuality. dul:hasQuality is a relation between entities and qualities, e.g. 'Dmitri's skin is yellowish'.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following RDF graph describes that feature of interest `<fridge/1>` has property `<fridge/1/consumption>` .\r\n\r\n```\r\n<fridge/1> seas:hasProperty <fridge/1/consumption> .\r\n```\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology> .

For example if a fridge uses alternative current energy, then several aspects of its energy consumption property may be quantified. Examples of such aspects include:\r\n\r\n- the active power consumption;\r\n- the reactive power consumption;\r\n- the phase of voltage relative to current;\r\n- the frequency;\r\n- the minimal operating value of the frequency;\r\n- the number of occurences of unusual values.\r\n\r\nThese are different properties of the same property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nex:activePower a owl:ObjectProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:subPropertyOf seas:hasProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:domain seas:PowerProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:range seas:PowerProperty .\r\n\r\n<fridge/1/consumption> a seas:FeatureOfInterest ;\r\n  ex:activePower <fridge/1/consumption/activePower> .\r\n```\r\n\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology> .
