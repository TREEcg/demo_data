Dataset A has an outgoing dcat:qualifiedRelation property to an intermediate node that has an outgoing dcterms:relation property to dataset B. The intermediate node is connected using dcat:hadRole to cdc:requirementLink. The proposal contained in the source dataset (e.g. a cdc:DesignDS or a cdc:AsBuiltDS after delivery) tries to answer the requirements contained in the target dataset (e.g. respectively a cdc:OwnerRequirementsDS, and a cdc:OwnerRequirementsDS or a cdc:DesignDS)."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .
