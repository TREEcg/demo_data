We are also throwing in some <a href=\"http://sioc-project.org/\">SIOC</a>, \n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://dublincore.org/documents/dc-rdf/index.shtml\">Dublin Core</a> and \n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfcal/\">iCal/RDF Calendar</a>. Our own \n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://data.semanticweb.org/ns/swc/ontology\">swc namespace</a> provides the glue for all this, as well as \n\t\t\t\tspecialised classes for things that have to do with conferences.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThis version of SWC has been slimmed down significantly (hence the revision name). A total of 59 classes and 19 properties have been deprecated (deprecated terms can be found at the bottom of this document). This was mostly done with the intention to remove the countless sub-classes of generic classes such as <a href=\"#Chair\">Chair</a> or <a href=\"#SessionEvent\">SessionEvent</a>, which were deemed to be too specific for a general-purpose conference ontology such as SWC. Elsewhere, classes and properties which had never been used and seemed to fall under the heading of \"over-engineering\" were removed. Finally, all CfP related terms were removed. Instead, we suggest to use a dedicated ontology such as the <a href=\"http://sw.deri.org/2005/08/conf/cfp\">CfP ontology</a>.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t" <http://data.semanticweb.org/ns/swc/ontology> .

This role instance stands in relation to a person (who plays the role) and an event. The figure below gives an example showing how to model the role of the metadata chair (or \"dog food tsar\") at ISWC+ASWC2007, which was held by Knud Möller (together with Tom Heath, not shown in the figure).\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tNote that the metadata chair role is not modelled with its own dedicated class (although it could have been).
