<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#FragmentFeature> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: An entity feature that represents the resulting physical entity subsequent to a cleavage or degradation event. \n\nUsage: Fragment Feature can be used to cover multiple types of modfications to the sequence of the physical entity: \n1.    A protein with a single cleavage site that converts the protein into two fragments (e.g. pro-insulin converted to insulin and C-peptide). TODO: CV term for sequence fragment?  PSI-MI CV term for cleavage site?\n2.    A protein with two cleavage sites that removes an internal sequence e.g. an intein i.e. ABC -> A\n3.    Cleavage of a circular sequence e.g. a plasmid.\n\nIn the case of removal ( e.g. intron)  the fragment that is *removed* is specified in the feature location property. In the case of a \"cut\" (e.g. restriction enzyme cut site) the location of the cut is specified instead.\nExamples: Insulin Hormone" <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
