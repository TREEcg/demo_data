<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Belief> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A belief is what an agent believes (which may be true or not in the world) In\n            the BDI model, beliefs form the agent's knowledge about the world that the agent\n            relies on for devising plans to achieve her goals. In Drammar there is no distinction\n            between knowing and believing, because reasoning concerns the agent motivations for\n            acting, rather than the relationship between single agent knowledge and shared\n            knowledge. A belief is formally defined as the type of MentalState described by a\n            BeliefSchema. In the annotation, it is in the scope a ConsistenStateSet, that is\n            precondition or effect of a Plan. SWRL rules for mapping project a belief onto some\n            ConsistentStateSet which precedes or follows a timeline." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

A virtual link is a connection between resources such as literals and instances with some commonality. Each of these resources is from a different RDF dataset. A resource mapping can be also considered when defining common resources between datasets. For example, the datasets uses different prefix namespaces for similar instances in a given domain scope. A virtual link can be interpreted as an intersection data point between two datasets. In addition, a virtual link is not concretely stored. The link may be physically established during a federated query execution, for example. This class must only have instances of its subclasses. It is recommendable to comment (rdfs:comment) the scope of the virtual link set."@en <http://purl.org/query/voidext> .
