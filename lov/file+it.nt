<https://w3id.org/fog#asShapefile> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The datatype relation pointing to a geometry description following the open Shapefile format developed by ESRI. The format consists of multiple files, including as a minimum the geometry (.shp), the index of the feature geometry (.shx) and attribute information of features (.dbf). These three files are binary, while others can be text-based (e.g. the .prj file). It is strongly adviced to use the more specific subsubproperties (e.g. fog:asShapefile-shp). Note that no file format version is provided by ESRI and that the format is expected to be stable."@en <https://w3id.org/fog> .
