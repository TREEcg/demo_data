There are five different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally.  All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies.  The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Diatoms are single-celled phytoplankton with an external skeleton made of silica. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .

For physical runways, the convention is to label runways by their heading, dropping the last digit. E.g. for Liverpool, runway 9/27 is facing approximately magnetic heading 90 degrees in one direction, and 270 degrees in the opposite direction. If an airport has parallel runways, these would then be marked Left, Center and Right, e.g. 9L, 9C, 9R.
