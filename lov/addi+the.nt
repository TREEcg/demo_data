<https://w3id.org/cdc#AdditionDistribution> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A cdc:AdditionDistribution is used to classify a distribution of a dataset B that complements another dataset A (connected using the cdc:complements relation). The content of the addition complement distribution of dataset B should be added to the entire content of dataset A to form dataset B. When the dataset B is the result of both additions and deletions on dataset A, dataset B should have a direct distribution with two subdistributions (cdc:hasSubDistribution): one containing triples to be deleted (cdc:DeletetionDistribution) from the source dataset and another containing triples that should be added (cdc:AdditionDistribution) to the source dataset."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .
