Any annotations on such a proxy will descrive the ro:Resource within that particular ro:ResearchObject, in particular dct:creator and dct:created on the proxy will specify who added the resource to the aggregation at what time.\n\nNote that annotations (ro:AggregatedAnnotation) can be added to both the ro:Resource and the ore:Proxy - depending on if the annotation is seen to be globally true (such as the provenance of how the resource was created) or locally true within the Research Object (such as the the resource playing the role of a wf4ever:Dataset).\n\nNot all resources aggregated by an ro:ResearchObject are ro:Resource instances, in particular ro:AggregatedAnnotations will also be aggregated, but will not be \"true\" RO resources (and thus don't need their own ore:Proxy).  \n\nAggregated resources MAY also be organised in (potentially nested) ro:Folders to reflect a file-system like structure.
