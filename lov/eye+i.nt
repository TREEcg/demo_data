Light, for example, as the portion of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye, is radiation with wavelengths in the range of approx. 380 to 780 nm (1 nm = 10 m). The corresponding range of colours varies from violet to indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. These colours form a continuous spectrum, in which the various spectral sectors merge into each other."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
