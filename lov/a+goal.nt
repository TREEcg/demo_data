<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Plan> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Plan A plan is a sequence of actions devised by an agent to achieve some Goal.\n            In the BDI model, the agent's 'intention' to execute a plan is the bridge\n            between goals and practical actions. In Drammar, a plan is intended by (intendedBy\n            object property) an Agent to achieve (achieve property) some Goal. As a consequence, the\n            plan motivates (isMotivationFor object property) a timeline (i.e. a given extent of the\n            drama text). These are the necessary and sufficient conditions of class. Following the\n            paradigm of hierarchical planning, plans are recursive. So plans can contains actions or\n            other, simpler plans. Formally, a Plan is a list (namely, it is a subclass of the List\n            class) whose elements are simpler plans (for abstract plans) or actions (for directly\n            executable plans). A plan is related to its elements by the containsOLE\n            property." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#MentalState> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "MentalStates are EventiveStates that are attributed to the mind of an agent.\n            There are four types of mental states: 1. Emotion 2. Belief 3. Goal 4. Value Belief and\n            Goal are traditionally described as having a propositional content because they both\n            concern some attitude of the agent toward a proposition; in Drammar, we don't\n            enforce this distinction because the reference theoriesd we adopt for emotion and values\n            also enforce some time of propositional content. The only difference is that only the\n            schema types for beliefs and goals (BeliefSchema and GoalSchema) have a propositional\n            content attached to it (through the propositionalContent object property). A MentalState\n            is defined as an EventiveState that is described by a MentalStateSchema. The latter are\n            to be specified as EmotionSchema, BeliefSchema, GoalSchema, ValueSchema,\n            depending on the MentalState type: so, the MentalStateSchema type works as a selector\n            for the right trait of the mental schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
