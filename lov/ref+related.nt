For instance, in the phrase 'The Russian daily RBK', the mention 'daily' refers to a daily newpaper, but in Wikipedia we only have wiki:Newspaper, so 'daily' can be seen as a reference to the closely related wiki:Newspaper. (Such references are sometimes reflected, for example, with redirects in Wikipedia, or pointers to a subsection of an entity's article.)"@en <http://w3id.org/vcb/fel#> .
