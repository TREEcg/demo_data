The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\n\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- currency: £26.00\n- length: 3.9-4.1 cm\n- diameter: 26 mm\n- weight: 150 lbs\n- density: 0.85 gm/cc\n- luminescence: 56 ISO lumens\n- tin content: 0.46 %\n- taille au garot: 5 hands\n- calibrated C14 date: 2460-2720 years, etc\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE54(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The distinction between corporate and personal names, which is particularly important in library applications, should be made by explicitly linking the E82 Actor Appellation to an instance of either E21 Person or E74 Group/E40 Legal Body. If this is not possible, the distinction can be made through the use of the P2 has type mechanism.\n\nExamples:\n- \"John Doe\"\n- \"Doe, J\"\n- \"the U.S. Social Security Number 246-14-2304\"\n- \"the Artist Formerly Known as Prince\"\n- \"the Master of the Flemish Madonna\"\n- \"Raphael's Workshop\"\n- \"the Brontë Sisters\"\n- \"ICOM\"\n- \"International Council of Museums\"\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE82(x) ⊃ E41(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
