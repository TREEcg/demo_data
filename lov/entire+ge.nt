E.g. a point cloud of a columns laser scan in a high geometric detail complementing a simplified CSG geometry of the same column. Both geometry descriptions are closely related, but not directly derived from each other. The complementing geometry description may also just depict a small part of the entire geometry (e.g. the column header)."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
