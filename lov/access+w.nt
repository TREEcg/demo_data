<http://purl.org/spar/pso/gratis-open-access> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The status of a published work which is free to read on-line, in contrast to subscription-access works, but to which licensing restrictions apply, limiting the possibilities for downloading, text mining, modification, re-publication or re-use of the published work.  The term Gratis Open Access thus signifies absence of a price barrier to view.  While both imply ‘free’ (a potentially ambiguous word), Gratis Open Access equates to ‘free as in beer’ while Libre Open Access (q.v.) equates to ‘free as in speech’.  Gratis Open Access is thus a necessary but not a sufficient condition for true Libre Open Access.   Many ‘open access’ publications by commercial scholarly publishers are only Gratis Open Access, while almost all publications by ‘pure’ Open Access scholarly publishers are Libre Open Access.

The communicator decided when a concrete work was broadcasted and the consumers had just to the option to get or not access to the communication medium in order to consume the content. Consumers did not have any alternative to time-shift content consumption without the intervention of recording mediums.\nHowever, communication mediums that allow user interaction have appeared, among which the Internet is the more important one nowadays. The consequence is a particular kind of communication where members of the public access works from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. This kind of communication is called to MakeAvailable in the copyright context."@en <http://rhizomik.net/ontologies/copyrightonto.owl> .
