<http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#AggregatedAnnotation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An annotation aggregated within an ro:ResearchObject.  \n\nInstances of this class are used to annotated resources aggregated within the aggregating research object, proxies of these resources, or the research object itself. In other words, if :ro is the ro:ResearchObject this annotation has been ore:isAggregatedBy, then the annotation should have at least one ao:annotatesResource which is an ore:AggregatedResource which is ore:isAggregatedBy :ro, or the annotated resource is an ore:Proxy which ore:proxyIn :ro, or the annotated resource is :ro.\n\nIt is possible for the annotation to also annotate non-aggregated resources, but as above, at least one of them needs to be part of the RO or the RO itself.\n\nAs a subclass of ro:SemanticAnnotation the ao:body must point to an rdfg:Graph which contains the actual annotation.

<http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This resource has a more specific, versioned resource. This property is intended for relating a non-versioned or abstract resource to several versioned resources, e.g. snapshots. For instance, if there are two snapshots of the News page, made on 23rd and 24th of December, then: <http://news.example.com/> pav:hasVersion <http://news.example.com/2013-12-23/> ; pav:hasVersion <http://news.example.com/2013-12-24/> . If one of the versions has somewhat the equivalent content to this resource (e.g. can be used as a permalink for this resource), then it should instead be indicated with the subproperty pav:hasCurrentVersion: <http://news.example.com/> pav:hasCurrentVersion <http://news.example.com/2013-12-25 > . To order the versions, use pav:previousVersion: <http://news.example.com/2013-12-25/> pav:previousVersion <http://news.example.com 2013-12-24/> . <http://news.example.com/2013-12-24/> pav:previousVersion <http://news.example.com/2013-12-23/> . Note that it might be confusing to also indicate pav:previousVersion from a resource that has pav:hasVersion relations, as such a resource is intended to be a long-living 'unversioned' resource. The PAV ontology does however not formally restrict this, to cater for more complex scenarios with multiple abstraction levels. pav:hasVersion is a subproperty of dcterms:hasVersion to more strongly define this hierarchical pattern. It is therefore also a subproperty of pav:generalizationOf (inverse of prov:specializationOf). To indicate the existence of other, non-hierarchical kind of editions and adaptations of this resource that are not versioned snapshots (e.g. Powerpoint slides has a video recording version), use instead dcterms:hasVersion or prov:alternateOf."@en <http://purl.org/net/tsn#> .
