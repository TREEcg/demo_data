<https://w3id.org/GConsent#MinorDataSubject> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Minor is a Data Subject who cannot provide their own consent (that is legally valid). Therefore, their consent must be obtained via a Guardian or Legal Representative or Parent. Minor is a subclass of Data Subject.\n\nConsent given in lieu of a Minor (by their Representative) is associated with the `ConsentInstance` class/instance using the `wasGivenBy` property.\n\nThe ontology currently does not capture this relationship between the Minor and their Representative. This is due to required clarifications regarding how this role should be represented. For example, the `DataSubject` cannot be subclassed to create a `Representative` class, as this would make the `DataSubject` a permanent representative for the Minor. Instead, the role of 'acting as representative' is only for the instance of the given consent. Therefore, this could be represented with a `ConsentRepresentativeRole` class that links to the `MinorDataSubject` with `roleHadDataSubject` property, and the `DataSubject` that gave the consent via the `roleHadRepresentative` property. The relationship or reason or situation of this given consent can be captured by further annotating the `ConsentRepresentativeRole` instance. This approach can also be extended to other similar situations where one `DataSubject` gives consent in lieu of another.\n\nNote: A Minor can provide their own consent in certain cases, or conversely, a minor's consent may need to be provided by a 'parental' representative in some cases."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .

For location depicted or described in the content, use <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/contentLocation\">contentLocation</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nDateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially.
