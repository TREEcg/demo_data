<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Unit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Unit Units are the segmentation of drama. A drama can have multiple\n            segmentations. Units are ordered by some Timeline. Units are devoted to the\n            representation of characters' actions. So, we require that any unit contains at\n            least one action whose description (ProcessSchema) encompasses at least one role having\n            an agent as a filler. If a building collapses, this action, by itself, can be part of\n            Unit only if an agent is involved in it (e.g., an agent dies). This definition\n            guarantees that, in the minimal case, at least one agent appears as filler of the roles\n            in the description of at least an action of every unit. A Unit has one or more actions\n            as its members (hasMember property)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#SetMember> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Class of the elements\n            of the sets (sets are conflict sets, consistent state sets, and units). Sometimes\n            referred to as SM. The hasMember object property has the Set class as its domain and the\n            SetMember as its range. Notice that this class works as a placeholder that represents\n            the single element in a set (it is not the content itself): the property hasData links\n            the SetMember with the actual data, i.e. the content of the item. For example, the\n            specific Set that is a Unit hasMember some SetMember that hasData some\n            Action." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
