Most languages have phonemic contrasts between voiced and voiceless sounds (regular vibration of the vocal folds versus no vibration of the vocal folds respectively). However, Ladefoged and Maddieson recognize five steps in the continuum of modes of vibration in the glottis, going from breathy voice - the most open setting of the vocal folds in which vibration will occur, passing through slack voice, modal voice, and stiff voice, ending with creaky voice - the most constricted setting in which vibration will occur. Each of these modes of voicing may or may not be phonemic in a given language. [Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 48-49]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
