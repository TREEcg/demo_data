<https://w3id.org/cdc#DataManagementTag> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A tag that is linked to a DCAT catalog, dataset, distribution or data service instance node using the cdc:hasDataManagementTag property. CDC predefines three instances of this class, i.e. cdc:incoming, cdc:internal and cdc:outgoing. Each catalog, dataset, distribution or data service can only have one tag that is not supposed to change over the lifetime of the described resource unless it considers a dataset (that is not a catalog). When necessary, qualified relations between DCAT entities can also get a tag."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .

This means that there is an overlap between the contexts of both datasets such as the construction described, the content type (e.g. two alternative designs (cdc:DesignDS) or two historical as built situations based on different sources (cdc:HistoricalAsBuiltDS)) and/or the timing. In the case of two alternative designs, the related owner requirements should be the same.
