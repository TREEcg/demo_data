For physical runways, the convention is to label runways by their heading, dropping the last digit. E.g. for Liverpool, runway 9/27 is facing approximately magnetic heading 90 degrees in one direction, and 270 degrees in the opposite direction. If an airport has parallel runways, these would then be marked Left, Center and Right, e.g. 9L, 9C, 9R. For operational runways, the runway identifiers specifies one direction only: either 9 or 27 in the Liverpool example." <https://data.nasa.gov/ontologies/atmonto/NAS#> .

The float may be a ball attached to a lever or other mechanism HYDRAULIC: A valve that is opened and closed by hydraulic actuation LEVER: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a lever rotating the gate within the valve. LOCKSHIELD: A valve that requires the use of a special lockshield key for opening and closing, the operating mechanism being protected by a shroud during normal operation. MOTORIZED: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of an electric motor on an actuator PNEUMATIC: A valve that is opened and closed by pneumatic actuation SOLENOID: A valve that is normally held open by a magnetic field in a coil acting on the gate but that is closed immediately if the electrical current generating the magnetic field is removed. SPRING: A valve that is normally held in position by the pressure of a spring on a plate but that may be caused to open if the pressure of the fluid is sufficient to overcome the spring pressure. THERMOSTATIC: A valve in which the ports are opened or closed to maintain a required predetermined temperature. WHEEL: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a wheel moving the gate within the valve."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
