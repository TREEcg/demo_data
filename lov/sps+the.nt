<http://spinrdf.org/spin#select> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Executes a given SELECT or ASK query (or a corresponding SPIN template call) and binds its result rows to the variables specified on the right hand side. May also pre-bind variables for the query execution, using name-value pairs on the left hand side.\n\nExample:\n\n    (?query \"this\" owl:Thing) spin:select (?a ?b)\n\nwill execute the sp:Select or sp:Ask that ?query points to and pre-bind ?this with the value of owl:Thing for the execution of the query. The first result variable of the query's result set will be bound to ?a, the second to ?b etc. If the nodes on the right are bound (or constants) then it will match with the values from the result set." <http://spinrdf.org/spin> .
