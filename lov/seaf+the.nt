<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/P161_has_spatial_projection> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis property associates an instance of a E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E53 Place that is the result of the spatial projection of the instance of a E92 Spacetime Volume on a reference space. In general there can be more than one useful reference space to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, such as that of a battle ship versus that of the seafloor. Therefore the projection is not unique. \nThis is part of the fully developed path that is shortcut by P7took place at (witnessed. The more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place.\n\nExample\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP161(x,y) ⊃ E92(x)\nP161(x,y) ⊃ E53(y)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
