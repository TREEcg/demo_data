The exact meaning of _contribute_ is defined by sub properties of `seas:subSystemOf`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a fridge is a subsystem of a kitchen, then its consumption power contributes to the consumption power of the kitchen. \r\n\r\nProperty `seas:subSystemOf` is functional, and should be asymmetric:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif x seas:subSystemOf y1 and x seas:subSystemOf y2, then y1 and y2 refer to the same resource.\r\nif x seas:subSystemOf y, then it can't be the case that y seas:subSystemOf x.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe asymmetric aspect of property `seas:subSystemOf` would prevents a system from being its own sub-system. Unfortunately, OWL 2 DL disallow a non-simple property (e.g., a functional property) from being asymmetric, see OWL 2 Syntax section 11.\r\n\r\nIf it was possible that both the fridge and the kitchen be sub systems of a common super system, say, the house, then the consumption power of the fridge would contribute twice to the consumption power of the house. The functional aspect of property `seas:subSystemOf` prevents this undesired effect. \r\n\r\nDue to the open world assumption of RDF, it is not possible to model the closed set of sub systems of a system using property `seas:subSystemOf`.\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/SystemOntology> .
