This means that there is an overlap between the contexts of both datasets such as the construction described, the content type (e.g. two alternative designs (cdc:DesignDS) or two historical as built situations based on different sources (cdc:HistoricalAsBuiltDS)) and/or the timing. In the case of two alternative designs, the related owner requirements should be the same. When considering two alternative historical as-built situations, the temporal context should have an overlap."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .
