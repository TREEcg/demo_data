<http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#Workflow> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A wfdesc:Workflow is a directed graph in which the nodes are wfdesc:Process instances and the edges (wfdesc:DataLink instances) represent data dependencies between the constituent wfdesc:Process descriptions.\n\nThe resource that contains the wfdesc:WorkflowDefinition (say the XML file saved from a workflow designer tool) can be specified with wfdesc:hasWorkflowDefinition. Research objects might aggregate a wfdesc:Workflow, a wfdesc:WorkflowDefinition, or (recommended) both.\n\nA wfdesc:Workflow defines associated wfdesc:Process using wfdesc:hasSubProcess. A specialisation of this property is wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow, signifying that the process is a wfdesc:Workflow itself, which is further described in a similar fashion.\n\nAs a subclass of wfdesc:Process a wfdesc:Workflow can also define wfdesc:hasInput/wfdesc:hasOutput parameters - these would be inputs taken at workflow execution time, and final outputs of the workflow. (Note: Not all dataflow systems have this concept of workflow parameters)\n\nwfdesc:Parameter descriptions are linked using wfdesc:DataLink descriptions associated with the wfdesc:Workflow using wfdesc:hasDataLink.\n\nA wfdesc:Parameter defined with wfdesc:hasInput on a wfdesc:Workflow is considered an wfdesc:Input \"outside\" the workflow (ie. if it is a subworkflow), but an wfdesc:Output \"inside\" the workflow (where it can be connected to a wfdesc:Input of a wfdesc:Process). Thus such parameters can be linked \"through\" the workflow without having a \"mirrored\" port inside.\n\n\nExample:\n\n```\n@prefix wfdesc: <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#> .\n:outerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow :innerWorkflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubProcess :procA, :procC .\n\n:procA a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param1 .\n\n:procC a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param2 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param3 .\n\n\n:innerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param4 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param5 ;\n  wfdesc:hasProcess :procB .\n\n:procB a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param6 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param7 .\n\n:innerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param4; wfdesc:hasSink :param6 ],\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param7; wfdesc:hasSink :param5 ] .\n\n:outerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param1; wfdesc:hasSink :param4 ],\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param5; wfdesc:hasSink :param2 ] .\n```\n\n\nIn this example :param1 is the output of :procA. :param1 is the source in a datalink that goes to the input :param4 of the :innerWorkflow. :param4 is however also the source of an inner datalink, going to input :param6 of the nested :procB.\n\nFrom this :param4 is both an wfdesc:Input and wfdesc:Output (which is why these two classes are not disjoint)"@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc> .

<http://caressesrobot.org/ontology> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:\n\n- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?\n- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? \n- Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?\n- Topics of conversation.  Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?\n\nThe CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:\n\n- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner\n- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.\n- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted person’s preferences and needs.\n\nPlease refer to the following for additional information:\n- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;\n- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.
