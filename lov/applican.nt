The latter is typically written by the author of a journal article submitted for publication, or by an applicant making a grant application, in response to reviews of the work from peer reviewers prior to publication (for the journal article) or prior to funding decision (for the grant application).  Alternatively, it can be written in response to post-publication peer-review of a published journal article, or comments about it."@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
