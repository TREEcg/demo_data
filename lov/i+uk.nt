Several such vocabularies exist, many of which map to the UN's ISIC codes. Where a particular controlled vocabulary is in use within a given context, such as SIC codes in the UK, it is acceptable to use these, however, the preferred choice for European interoperability is NACE. rov:orgActivity is a sub class of org:classification which has a range of skos:Concept."@en <http://www.w3.org/ns/regorg> .

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\n\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring\n- the place referred to in the phrase: \"Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone\"\n- here -> <-\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE53(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
