The geometric interiors of any two Surfaces in a MultiSurface may not intersect in the full coordinate system. The boundaries of any two coplanar elements in a MultiSurface may intersect, at most, at a finite number of Points. If they were to meet along a curve, they could be merged into a single surface.\nA MultiSurface may be used to represent heterogeneous surfaces collections of polygons and polyhedral surfaces. It defines a set of methods for its subclasses. The subclass of MultiSurface is MultiPolygon corresponding to a collection of Polygons only. Other collections shall use MultiSurface.\n    "@en <http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf> .

<http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf#Surface> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "\nA Surface is a 2-dimensional geometric object.\nA simple Surface may consists of a single patch that is associated with one exterior boundary and 0 or more interior boundaries. A single such Surface patch in 3-dimensional space is isometric to planar Surfaces, by a simple affine rotation matrix that rotates the patch onto the plane z = 0. If the patch is not vertical, the projection onto the same plane is an isomorphism, and can be represented as a linear transformation, i.e. an affine.\nPolyhedral Surfaces are formed by stitching together such simple Surfaces patches along their common boundaries. Such polyhedral Surfaces in a 3-dimensional space may not be planar as a whole, depending on the orientation of their planar normals. If all the patches are in alignment (their normals are parallel), then the whole stitched polyhedral surface is co-planar and can be represented as a single patch if it is connected.\nThe boundary of a simple Surface is the set of closed Curves corresponding to its exterior and interior boundaries.\nA Polygon is a simple Surface that is planar. A PolyhedralSurface is a simple surface, consisting of some number of Polygon patches or facets. If a PolyhedralSurface is closed, then it bounds a solid. A MultiSurface containing a set of closed PolyhedralSurfaces can be used to represent a Solid object with holes.\n    "@en <http://www.opengis.net/ont/sf> .
