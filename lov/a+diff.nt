For example, scientific granularities (e.g. body-organ-tissue-cell) or ontological 'strata' (e.g. social-mental-biological-physical) are  typical layerings. \nIntuitively, a constituent is a part belonging to a lower layer. Since layering is actually a partition of the world described by the ontology, constituents are not properly classified as parts, although this kinship can be intuitive for common sense.\nA desirable advantage of this distinction is that we are able to talk e.g. of physical constituents of non-physical objects (e.g. systems), while this is not possible in terms of parts.\nExample of are the persons constituting a social system, the molecules constituting a person, the atoms constituting a river, etc. \nIn all these examples, we notice a typical discontinuity between the constituted and the constituent object: e.g. a social system is conceptualized at a different layer from the persons that constitute it, a person is conceptualized at a different layer from the molecules that constitute them, and a river is conceptualized at a different layer from the atoms that constitute it." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This ontology is a composition of some content design patterns for the semiotic triangle.\nIts structure is extracted from DOLCE-Ultralite (DOLCE+c.DnS), but it uses a different terminology, and explicitly defines the semiotic function: Expression is the semiotic term for dul:InformationObject, when they actually express or denote something; Meaning is the semiotic term for dul:SocialObject, when they are actually expressed by something, or are interpretation of something; Reference is the semiotic term for dul:Entity, when they are interpreted or denoted by something.\nThe denotes relation is equivalent to dul:isAbout, the expresses relation is imported from DOLCE Ultralite, and the hasInterpretation relation generalizes over: dul:isClassifiedBy, dul:isCoveredBy, dul:isDescribedBy, dul:isUnifiedBy, and dul:satisfies\n\nExtensions to the triangle:\nA typical extension of the semiotic triangle concerns the participation of agents: this is introduced by using the dul:conceptualizes relation, holding between a dul:Agent and a dul:SocialObject (the Meaning). \nAn additional extension concerns semiotic context: this is provided by including four notions of 'Context': 'Paradigm' (the context of the conceptualized meaning), 'KnowledgeCollective' (the context of agents that conceptualize the paradigm), 'Cotext' (the context of expressions), and dul:Situation (the context of denoted entities).\nA final extension links semiotics to formal semantics: this is provided by reusing dul:FormalEntity, iol:isGroundingFor, iol:FormalExpression, iol:isAssignedTo, iol:FormalLanguage, etc.\n\nThe complete pattern allows to declare relations between Expression(s) and their Reference(s) (denotes), between Expression(s) and their Meaning (dul:expresses), between Meaning(s) and Reference(s) (isInterpretationOf), between Reference(s) and dul:FormalEntity(ies) (iol:isGroundingFor), between dul:FormalEntity(ies) and iol:FormalExpression(s) (iol:isAssignedTo).\n\nThis 'formalization pathway' moves from Expression(s) to iol:FormalExpression(s) by taking into account both Meaning(s) and Referent(s). The informal denotation of Expression(s) is moved to a formal denotation (iol:isAssignedTo) of iol:FormalExpression(s).\nFor example: the Expression 'Mariachi' dul:expresses the dul:Concept (Meaning) 'MexicanStreetSinger' that isInterpretationOf the dul:Collection (Reference) 'TheStreetSingersFromMexico'. 'TheStreetSingersFromMexico' then iol:isGroundingFor e.g. the dul:Set (dul:FormalEntity) that includes all Mexican street singers, which iol:isAssignedTo e.g. the iol:FormalExpression 'owl:Class#Mariachi'.\n\nThe formalization pathway enables a technique to move from/to socio-cognitive and formal semantics through denotation, in the Tarskian sense. As a matter of fact, translating directly a Meaning into a FormalEntity (or viceversa) is not always clearly implementable, while passing through an extensional grounding is easier and more accessible to intuition.\n\nAmong possible uses, information extraction, ontology learning, KOS reengineering, lexical semantics, etc. For example, statistical learning of instances for a dul:Concept would be modelled as the building of a dul:Collection that isInterpretationOf the dul:Concept, but also dul:isGroundingFor a dul:Set that iol:isAssignedTo e.g. an owl:Class.\n\nAn additional semiotic pattern is based on the hasInterpretant relation, which allows to link two Expression(s) (or dul:InformationRealization(s)), when the second one counts as a Meaning (or a relatedMeaning) of the first. \nIn practice, this is implemented by allowing a relation between an Expression (or its realization), and whatever Meaning (or another dul:InformationRealization). Technically speaking, the correct path would be passing through another Expression used to express a Meaning for the first one:\n\n(Exp1 hasInterpretant some (Exp2 and expresses some (Meaning and isExpressedBy some Exp1)))\n\nor even:\n\n(Exp1 hasInterpretant some (Exp2 and expresses some (Meaning and relatedMeaning some (Meaning and isExpressedBy some Exp1))))\n\nbut given the expressive power of OWL, which lacks co-reference, this is the best sub-optimal solution."@en <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> .

<http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo#NaiveBayes> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n\nNaive Bayes has been studied extensively since the 1950s. It was introduced under a different name into the text retrieval community in the early 1960s:488 and remains a popular (baseline) method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features. With appropriate preprocessing, it is competitive in this domain with more advanced methods including support vector machines.It also finds application in automatic medical diagnosis.\n\nNaive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.\n\nIn the statistics and computer science literature, Naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes.[4] All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method Russell and Norvig note that \"[naive Bayes] is sometimes called a Bayesian classifier, a somewhat careless usage that has prompted true Bayesians to call it the idiot Bayes model."@en <http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo> .

L'ontologie permet de représenter : 1) La hiérarchie d'une société : Groupe (Entreprise), Divisions d'un groupe, Marques d'une division ou d'un groupe, 2) La production d'une société : Gammes de produits (attachées à une marque), produits d'une gamme, packages de produits (un panier alimentaire par exemple), composition des produits...\n\nQuels apports ? \n\n- pv:Range\nDans ProVoc, nous introduisons les gammes de produits pv:Range.\nGoodRelations défini des variantes de produits  (http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/Product_variants, http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html#isVariantOf) : \"A variant is a specialization of a product model and inherits all of its product properties, unless they are defined locally. This allows a very compact modeling of product models that vary only in  a few properties.\"\nD'après GoodRelations, une variante d'un MacBook est par exemple un MacBook13Inch ou un MacBook15Inch qui varient par leur taille d'écran  et la quantité de ports USB disponibles. Il s'agit d'héritage entre un produit « parent » et ses dérivés qui doivent respecter les normes imposées par le produit « parent » (à moins de redéfinir les valeurs). Dans la version actuelle de GoodRelations, il existe une relation gr:isVariantOf nécessairement entre deux modèles de produits ou service. Or, les gammes de produits peuvent difficilement être traitées comme un ensemble de dérivés d'un produit/modèle commun. Par exemple, Elsève est une gamme proposant des shampooings avec des dérivés, mais Elsève propose aussi des Colorations avec des dérivés,  des Huiles avec des dérivés etc etc, donc à part qu'il s'agit de traitement pour les cheveux, ces  produits n'ont pas grand-chose en commun. En utilisant gr:isVariantOf entre certains produits « proches », on aurait plusieurs clusters de produits apparentés, au détriment d'une gamme unique. L'utilisation de pv:Range permet de respecter la structure fournie par l'expert, non subjective.\nEn conclusion, les variantes semblent pertinentes pour identifier des produits similaires (voir également http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo qui ne se différencie de isVariantOf que par le fait que le domain et le range de isSimilarTo sont plus large), mais les gammes de produits ont une toute autre vocation.\ngr:isVariantOf a une sémantique très large et subjective (comme pour isSimilarTo, d’ailleurs M. Hepp le dit clairement ici http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo). Par exemple, rien n’empêche d’exprimer qu’une Renault Clio 4 est une variante d’une Ford Fiesta (http://www.autonews.fr/nouveautes/nouveaute/104216-renault-clio-fiesta-prix/ pourtant elles ne sont pas de la même marque.  \nEnfin, notons qu'une pv:Range ne représente ni un produit ni un modèle de produit. pv:Range permet de lier une marque à ses produits de façon non subjective (fournie par l’expert). \nIl serait pertinent de limiter l’utilisation de gr:isVariantOf aux produits appartenant à une pv:Range.\n\n- pv:Package\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons la classe pv:Package qui permet de représenter des ensembles de produits vendus comme un unique produit. Par exemple un coffret de cosmétique contenant une BB crème, un gloss, et le parfum La vie est Belle de Lancôme. Un autre exemple est un panier alimentaire contenant différents produits.\n\n- pv:Provider\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons pv:Provider qui représente les fournisseurs de produits (par exemple Carrefour est fournisseur des produits Nutella).\n\n- pv:Component\nDans ProVoc nous introduisons pv:Component qui permet de décrire la composiiton d'un produit (par exemple, un parfum peut contenir du linalool).\n\nD'autres classes et propriétés sont introduites dans ProVoc dans le but de raffiner le modèle. Par exemple, pv:Model, pv:Designer, et pv:Ambassador sont des sous-classes de foaf:Person. ProVoc permet aussi de lier les composants d'un produit avec leur impact sur la santé (pv:healthImpact).\n\nConcernant les propriétés classiques liées directement au produit, telles que la couleur, le prix, la référence, la description, etc, voir Good Relations.\n"@fr <http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> .

<http://ns.inria.fr/provoc> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "ProVoc (Product Vocabulary) is a vocabulary that can be used to represent information and manipulate them through the Web. This ontology reflects: 1) The basic hierarchy of a company: Group (Company), Divisions of a Group, Brand names attached to a Division or a Group, and 2) The production of a company: products, ranges of products (attached to a Brand), the composition of a product, packages of products...\n\n\nWhat contributions ? \n\n- pv:Range\nIn ProVoc we introduce pv:Range.\nGoodRelations defined \"variants\" ( http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/Product_variants , http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1.html#isVariantOf ) as following: \"\"A variant is a specialization of a product model and inherits all of its product properties, unless they are defined locally. This allows a very compact modeling of product models that vary only in  a few properties. \"\nAccording to GoodRelations, a variant of a MacBook is for example a MacBook13Inch or MacBook15Inch which vary in screen size and in available USB ports. This is inheritage between a product model and its derivatives, which must meet the standards imposed by the product model (obviously values can be redefined locally). According to the current version of GoodRelations,gr:isVariantOf necessarily exists between two models of product or service. However, ranges of products can hardly be considered as a set of derivatives of a product (or model of product). For example, Elsève is a range of products offering shampoos with some derivatives, but Elsève also offers creams with derivatives, oils with derivatives etc., so apart that such products are related to treatment for hair, they have not much in common. Using gr:isVariantOf between certain 'close' products, we would obtain multiple clusters of related products, to the detriment of a unique range of products. Using pv:Range allows to respect the structure provided by the expert.\nIn conclusion, variants seem to identify similar products (see also http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo which differs from gr:isVariantOf by the fact that the domain and ranks of isSimilarTo are larger), but pv:range has a different vocation.\ngr:isVariantOf has a very broad and subjective semantics (such as gr:isSimilarTo, as Mr. Hepp said clearly here http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#isSimilarTo ). For example , with gr:isVariantOf it would be possible to express that a Renault Clio 4 is a variant of a Ford Fiesta ( http://www.autonews.fr/nouveautes/nouveaute/104216-renault-clio-fiesta-prix/ yet they are not of the same brand) whilst they are not of the same brand name.\nFinally, note that a pv:Range does not represent a set of products nor product models. pv:range is used to objectively link a brand to its products (provided by the expert).\nIt would be appropriate to limit the use of gr:isVariantOf to products belonging to a pv:Range.\n\n- pv:Package\nIn ProVoc we introduce the pv:Package class that is used to represent sets of products sold as a single product. For example a cosmetic box containing a BB cream, a lip gloss, and a perfume byl Lancôme.

On one hand, there are units that are derived by adding a prefix to the unit. The prefix is a name or associated symbol (e.g. kilo) that precedes a unit of measure (e.g. meter) to form a decimal multiple or submultiple (e.g. Kilometer). Derived units, obtained by the application of a prefix, measure the same physical quality as its base unit. On the other hand, there are another kind of simple derived units that are also obtained from exactly one base unit but they measure a different physical quality. They are obtained by changing the exponent of the unit in the dimensional equation. For instance, this is how square meters are derived from meters. This exponent is represented in MUO with the datatype property muo:dimensionalSize. Combining this two patterns we can represent units that are obtained from a prefix and that have a dimension size different from 1, for instance, the unit square kilometer."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Agent> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Agent. Derived from BDI model, a mentalist model of agent which sees the agent\n            as a rational entity who form intentions, or plans, (based on her beliefs) to achieve\n            her desires (or goals). See Bratman et al. 1988 and Cohen and Levesque 1995. Agents are\n            those entities in drama, that potentially - have goals (object property hasGoal); -\n            intend plans to achieve goals (object property intends); - participate in actions with\n            some role (object property isFillerOf); In addition, agents have emotional states (as a\n            result of targeted emotions appraisal processes) and have moral values (hasValue): -\n            feel emotions as a result of a cognitive appraisal process (specific object properties\n            link each the appraisal of each emotion type to the agent); - have values (object\n            property hasValue); The requirement, in drama, is that an agent has a plan, since the\n            fact of having a goal would not be sufficient to ensure that the goal is translated into\n            some concrete, perceivable behavior in drama. Having a plan, instead, implies that the\n            agent also has goal. Notice that some Agent (e.g. Polonius) is involved in an action\n            without being intentional (e.g., being the topic of a conversation), it remains\n            classified as an Agent in Drammar, though it fills a different role in the frame (e.g.,\n            Topic of Conversation).

In case of L1, a task is directly connected with the task method description. When using L2, a task is first connected to an intermediate property node via cp:hasTaskMethod. The intermediate node is then connected using cp:hasComplexTaskMethodDescription. In case of L3, the first intermediate node from L2 receives an outgoing opm:hasPropertyState property. The property state node is then connected to the task method description using cp:hasComplexTaskMethodDescrription. A task method description contains a step-by-step description of the procedure, used materials and equipment."@en <https://w3id.org/cto> .
