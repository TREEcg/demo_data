Many DO classes have been aligned with the PROV-O since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.\n\n                                  Unlike the original DO, this ontology cannot be used for *normative* scenarios: it is only capable of recording decisions that have already been made (so-called *data-driven* use in the DO).
