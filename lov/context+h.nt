On the contrary, a CoText is actually a neighborhood of a certain chunk of text, which can be built based on a syntagmatic rule (all words from the sentence where the chunk occurs), an associative rule (all terms that are related to the chunk across the texts of a corpus, given a certain statistical threshold), etc.\nContexts can also emerge based on what relations are considered \"context triggers\". For example, in this ontology very different relations: part, participation, setting, membership, acting for, localization, etc. are considered context triggers by adding owl:subPropertyOf axioms to the property: isContextOf. Since the class Context has an equivalent axiom to isContextOf someValuesFrom dul:Entity, everything has a property that is declared subPropertyOf isContextOf, will be inferred to be a Context as well." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> .
