The aggregated concept reflects the reality that there are many awarding bodies, including the AA, the ADAC, the national tourism organisations, etc. The awardRange specifies the maximal value an offering can achieve. Usual gradings like ‘+’ and ‘-‘ are represented by the values ‘.3’ and ‘.7’." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .

<https://w3id.org/GConsent#Processing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Processing is defined by the GDPR (Article 4-2) as \"any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\".\n\nProcessing can be considered as the action, within an activity for example, that uses data in a particular or specific way. Therefore, processing specifies what is happening to/with the data. \n\nTo define a type of processing (or its associated action), the Processing class should be subclassed for each type. Furthermore, each subclass should define a instance as a generic representative of that action. For example, \"collect\" as a type of processing (defined by the GDPR), is defined as the class DataCollection, which is a subclass of Processing, and has the individual CollectionOfPersonalData to represent a generic instance of the concept. This is to provide a ready-to-use ontology in terms of \"collect\" as an action, while also providing a way to specialise the action/processing.\nGConsent defines several such types of processing taken from the text of the GDPR."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
