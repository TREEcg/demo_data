<https://bmake.th-brandenburg.de/spv#> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "The main contribution of this vocabulary are five specific classes for structuring and collecting the following qualitative characteristics of scholarly papers: research objectives, research methods, research findings, future work, critique. An additional inner structure is proposed for research objectives, qualifying them as schema:StructuredValue and combining them from two lists: research action types and research artifacts. The specific classes are subclasses of schema:ItemList. In addition, the classes for research methods, research action types and research artifacts are declared as subclasses of enumeration. Thus the typical methods, activities and research artifacts of the research area can be listed in the vocabulary itself."@en <https://bmake.th-brandenburg.de/spv> .

It is aimed at the support of research groups in the field of Business Modeling and Knowledge Engineering (BMaKE) in their collaborative work for qualitatively analyzing scholarly papers as well as sharing the results of that analyses and judgements. The vocabulary is meant to be used at first as schema for OntoWiki. Since this system doesn't process blank nodes in the intended way, the abstract nodes for specifying qualitative aspects of scholarly papers shall be modeled explicitely."@en <https://bmake.th-brandenburg.de/spv> .
