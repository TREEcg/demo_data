That is to say that the resource either has no inbound links, or if it does, those links are from other resources that are in the same situation. Documents which are only linked from retired documents are also considered orphans."@en <https://privatealpha.com/ontology/content-inventory/1#> .

An SituationSchema (or, better, a subclass of\n            it) can be linked to its ExternalRefSchema by the hasExtRef object property, which has\n            the ExternalReference as its range. The quale_frame_URI data property connects the\n            SituationSchema with the FrameNet frame which correponds to it, following the paradigm\n            of Linked Data." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
