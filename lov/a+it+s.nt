A single event may be described by several programmes, for example one may give a break down by day, another by rooms, another by topic.\n\nA programme should not have Timeslots or Events if it subprogrammes. In effect this means there are two subclasses of Programme, but there's no need to express that in the data.\n\nA simple application only needs to operate on a single Programme at once." <http://purl.org/prog/> .
