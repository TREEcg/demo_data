For many Persistent Items we know the maximum life-span and can infer, that they must have ended to exist. We assume in that case an End of Existence, which may be as unnoticeable as forgetting the secret knowledge by the last representative of some indigenous nation.\n\nExamples:\n- the death of Mozart (E69) took out of existence Mozart (E21)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP93 (x,y) ⊃ E64(x)\nP93 (x,y) ⊃ E77(y)\nP93(x,y) ⊃ P12(x,y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
