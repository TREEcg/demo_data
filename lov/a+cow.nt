<http://purl.org/spar/fabio/Thesaurus> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A type of controlled vocabulary used in information retrieval applications for indexing or tagging purposes, in which relationships between terms are made explicit. These are normally hierarchical relationships (is-a, subsumption; e.g. a cow is a mammal), equivalency relationships relating non-preferred terms to preferred terms (e.g. pitch and frequency), or associative relationships, in which the relationship that exists is neither one of hierarchy or equivalence, but rather one of similarity (e.g. sports and leisure pursuits)."@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
