This instance is usually characterized by a minimal value, a maximal value, and a unit of measurement. \n\nExample: A seating capacity between 1 and 8 persons.\n\nNote: Users must keep in mind that ranges in here mean that ALL possible values in this interval are covered. (Sometimes, the actual commitment may be less than that: \"We sell cars from 2 - 12 seats\" does often not really mean that they have cars with 2,3,4,...12 seats.). Someone renting out two types of rowing boats, one that fits for 1 or 2 people, and another that must be operated by 4 people cannot claim to rent boats with a seating capacity between 1 and 4 people. He or she is offering two boat types for 1-2 and 4 persons.\n\t\t\nCompatibility with schema.org: This class is a subclass of http://schema.org/Quantity."@en <http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1> .

Such numerical in-text \nreference pointers are frequently aggregated, e.g. [4, 5, 6-9].  In such cases, the missing pointers to references 7 and 8 are inferred (and should be added explicitly to the XML mark-up at this point in the text!). \n\nOr by use of the author names (or the first author's name plus et al.) and the publication year in parentheses, thus: (Ko et al., 1999). \n\nOr, less commonly, by the use of a code, e.g. by specifying the first surname letter of the first three author of the cited work followed by the last two digits of the year of publication, this string of characters being enclosed within square brackets, thus: [KRR99]."@en <http://purl.org/spar/c4o> .
