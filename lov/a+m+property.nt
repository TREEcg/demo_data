That is, not a quality of an abstract entity as is also allowed by DUL's Quality, but rather an aspect of an entity that is intrinsic to and cannot exist without the entity and is observable by a sensor, or operable by an actuator. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a property may also itself be a feature of interest. For example if a fridge uses alternative current energy, then several aspects of its energy consumption property may be quantified. Examples of such aspects include:\r\n\r\n- the active power consumption;\r\n- the reactive power consumption;\r\n- the phase of voltage relative to current;\r\n- the frequency;\r\n- the minimal operating value of the frequency;\r\n- the number of occurences of unusual values.\r\n\r\nThese are different properties of the same property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nex:activePower a owl:ObjectProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:subPropertyOf seas:hasProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:domain seas:PowerProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:range seas:PowerProperty .\r\n\r\n<fridge/1/consumption> a seas:FeatureOfInterest ;\r\n  ex:activePower <fridge/1/consumption/activePower> .\r\n```\r\n\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#MentalState> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "MentalStates are EventiveStates that are attributed to the mind of an agent.\n            There are four types of mental states: 1. Emotion 2. Belief 3. Goal 4. Value Belief and\n            Goal are traditionally described as having a propositional content because they both\n            concern some attitude of the agent toward a proposition; in Drammar, we don't\n            enforce this distinction because the reference theoriesd we adopt for emotion and values\n            also enforce some time of propositional content. The only difference is that only the\n            schema types for beliefs and goals (BeliefSchema and GoalSchema) have a propositional\n            content attached to it (through the propositionalContent object property). A MentalState\n            is defined as an EventiveState that is described by a MentalStateSchema. The latter are\n            to be specified as EmotionSchema, BeliefSchema, GoalSchema, ValueSchema,\n            depending on the MentalState type: so, the MentalStateSchema type works as a selector\n            for the right trait of the mental schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
