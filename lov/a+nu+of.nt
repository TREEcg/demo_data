<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#EntityReference> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: An entity reference is a grouping of several physical entities across different contexts and molecular states, that share common physical properties and often named and treated as a single entity with multiple states by biologists. \n\nRationale:   Many protein, small molecule and gene databases share this point of view, and such a grouping is an important prerequisite for interoperability with those databases. Biologists would often group different pools of molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the cell's behavior, but they are still called calcium. For DNA, RNA and Proteins the grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for small molecules it is defined by the chemical structure.\n\nUsage: Entity references store the information common to a set of molecules in various states described in the BioPAX document, including database cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be phosphorylated in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) in a phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein (child of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins, including all possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to all of them and common references to protein databases containing more information about P53 would be stored in a Entity Reference.  \n\nComments: This grouping has three semantic implications:\n\n1.  Members of different pools share many physical and biochemical properties. This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and set of molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation terms and database identifiers.\n\n2. A small number of transitions seperates these pools. In other words it is relatively easy and frequent for a molecule to transform from one physical entity to another that belong to the same reference entity. For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53 becomes mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a nuclear reaction, in the latter sheer statistical improbability of synthesizing the same sequence without a template. If one thinks about the biochemical network as molecules transforming into each other, and remove edges that respond to transcription, translation, degradation and covalent modification of small molecules, each remaining component is a reference entity.\n\n3. Some of the pools in the same group can overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the experiments in molecular biology will only check for one state variable, rarely multiple, and never for the all possible combinations. So almost all statements that refer to the state of the molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with other pools. However no overlaps is possible between molecules of different groups." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

By contrast, devices do not participate in a chemical reaction/interaction during the technique.\n\nReagents are distinguished from study subjects/evaluants in that study subjects and evaluants are that about which conclusions are drawn and knowledge is sought in an investigation - while reagents, by definition, are not.  It should be noted, however, that reagent and study subject/evaluant roles can be borne by instances of the same type of material entity - but a given instance can only realize one of these roles in the execution of a given  assay. For example, taq polymerase can bear a reagent role or an evaluant role.  In a DNA sequencing assay aimed at generating sequence data about some plasmid, the reagent role of the taq polymerase is realized.

For example, dNTPs input into a PCR are reagents that become part of the material output of this technique, but this output has a new identity (ie that of a 'nucleic acid molecule') that is distinct from the identity of the dNTPs that comprise it.  Similarly, a biotin molecule input into a cell labeling technique are reagents that become part of the specified output, but the identity of the output is that of some modified cell specimen which shares identity with the input unmodified cell specimen, and not with the biotin label. Thus, we see that an important criteria of 'reagent-ness' is that it is a facilitator, and not the primary focus of an investigation or material processing technique (ie not the specified subject/evaluant about which knowledge is sought, or the specified output material of the technique)." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

It can be considered the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/result\">result</a> of an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/EndorseAction\">EndorseAction</a> in which the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/object\">object</a> of the action is rated positively by\nsome <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/agent\">agent</a>. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/Action\">Action</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nAn <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/EndorsementRating\">EndorsementRating</a> may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,\nendorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive." <http://schema.org/> .
