<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#EntityReference> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: An entity reference is a grouping of several physical entities across different contexts and molecular states, that share common physical properties and often named and treated as a single entity with multiple states by biologists. \n\nRationale:   Many protein, small molecule and gene databases share this point of view, and such a grouping is an important prerequisite for interoperability with those databases. Biologists would often group different pools of molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the cell's behavior, but they are still called calcium. For DNA, RNA and Proteins the grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for small molecules it is defined by the chemical structure.\n\nUsage: Entity references store the information common to a set of molecules in various states described in the BioPAX document, including database cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be phosphorylated in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) in a phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein (child of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins, including all possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to all of them and common references to protein databases containing more information about P53 would be stored in a Entity Reference.  \n\nComments: This grouping has three semantic implications:\n\n1.  Members of different pools share many physical and biochemical properties. This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and set of molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation terms and database identifiers.\n\n2. A small number of transitions seperates these pools. In other words it is relatively easy and frequent for a molecule to transform from one physical entity to another that belong to the same reference entity. For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53 becomes mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a nuclear reaction, in the latter sheer statistical improbability of synthesizing the same sequence without a template. If one thinks about the biochemical network as molecules transforming into each other, and remove edges that respond to transcription, translation, degradation and covalent modification of small molecules, each remaining component is a reference entity.\n\n3. Some of the pools in the same group can overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the experiments in molecular biology will only check for one state variable, rarely multiple, and never for the all possible combinations. So almost all statements that refer to the state of the molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with other pools. However no overlaps is possible between molecules of different groups." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#Catalysis> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A control interaction in which a physical entity (a catalyst) increases the rate of a conversion interaction by lowering its activation energy. Instances of this class describe a pairing between a catalyzing entity and a catalyzed conversion.\nRationale: Catalysis, theoretically, is always bidirectional since it acts by lowering the activation energy. Physiologically, however, it can have a direction because of the concentration of the participants. For example, the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by Isocitrate dehydrogenase always happens in one direction under physiological conditions since the produced carbon dioxide is constantly removed from the system.\n   \nUsage: A separate catalysis instance should be created for each different conversion that a physicalEntity may catalyze and for each different physicalEntity that may catalyze a conversion. For example, a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes two different biochemical reactions would be linked to each of those biochemical reactions by two separate instances of the catalysis class. Also, catalysis reactions from multiple different organisms could be linked to the same generic biochemical reaction (a biochemical reaction is generic if it only includes small molecules). Generally, the enzyme catalyzing a conversion is known and the use of this class is obvious, however, in the cases where a catalyzed reaction is known to occur but the enzyme is not known, a catalysis instance can be created without a controller specified.\nSynonyms: facilitation, acceleration.\nExamples: The catalysis of a biochemical reaction by an enzyme, the enabling of a transport interaction by a membrane pore complex, and the facilitation of a complex assembly by a scaffold protein. Hexokinase -> (The \"Glucose + ATP -> Glucose-6-phosphate +ADP\" reaction). A plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase is an active transporter (antiport pump) using the energy of ATP to pump Na+ out of the cell and K+ in. Na+ from cytoplasm to extracellular space would be described in a transport instance. K+ from extracellular space to cytoplasm would be described in a transport instance. The ATPase pump would be stored in a catalysis instance controlling each of the above transport instances. A biochemical reaction that does not occur by itself under physiological conditions, but has been observed to occur in the presence of cell extract, likely via one or more unknown enzymes present in the extract, would be stored in the CONTROLLED property, with the CONTROLLER property empty." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

It is, however, standard in biology to treat them as different states of the same entity, where the entity is loosely defined based on sequence. Entity Feature class and its subclassses captures these variable characteristics. A Physical Entity in BioPAX represents a pool of  molecules rather than an individual molecule. This is a notion imported from chemistry( See PhysicalEntity). Pools are defined by a set of Entity Features in the sense that a single molecule must have all of the features in the set in order to be considered a member of the pool. Since it is impossible to list and experimentally test all potential features for an  entity, features that are not listed in the selection criteria is neglected Pools can also be defined by the converse by specifying features  that are known to NOT exist in a specific context. As DNA, RNA and Proteins can be hierarchically organized into families based on sequence homology so can entity features. The memberFeature property allows capturing such hierarchical classifications among entity features.\n\n\nUsage: Subclasses of entity feature describe most common biological instances and should be preferred whenever possible. One common usecase for instantiating  entity feature is, for describing active/inactive states of proteins where more specific feature information is not available.  \n\nExamples: Open/close conformational state of channel proteins, \"active\"/\"inactive\" states, excited states of photoreactive groups." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#PhysicalEntity> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A pool of molecules or molecular complexes. \n\nComments: Each PhysicalEntity is defined by a  sequence or structure based on an EntityReference AND any set of Features that are given. For example,  ser46 phosphorylated p53 is a physical entity in BioPAX defined by the p53 sequence and the phosphorylation feature on the serine at position 46 in the sequence.  Features are any combination of cellular location, covalent and non-covalent bonds with other molecules and covalent modifications.  \n\nFor a specific molecule to be a member of the pool it has to satisfy all of the specified features. Unspecified features are treated as unknowns or unneccesary. Features that are known to not be on the molecules should be explicitly stated with the \"not feature\" property. \nA physical entity in BioPAX  never represents a specific molecular instance. \n\nPhysical Entity can be heterogenous and potentially overlap, i.e. a single molecule can be counted as a member of multiple pools. This makes BioPAX semantics different than regular chemical notation but is necessary for dealing with combinatorial complexity. \n\nSynonyms: part, interactor, object, species\n\nExamples: extracellular calcium, ser 64 phosphorylated p53" <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
