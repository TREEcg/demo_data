The term 'line' is used when a culture has undergone an intentional experimental process to establish a more uniform and stable population of cells (see 'establishing cell line'). This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, 'lines' are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time. A *new* cell line can be \"established\" not only through the passaging/selection of a primary culture, but also through experimental modifications of existing lines (e.g. immortalization, stable genetic modifications, drug selection for a resistant subset, etc.).  As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quescent state for future use. \n\n2. The definitional criteria provided here for the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.?\n\n3. Definitinal criteria are intended to be sufficiently clear to specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world. A 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this common history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to the collection of all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as cells in these collections will likely not all share a common culture history. Rather, 'HeLa cell line' could refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).  As noted above, it is such collections that are typically referred to in scientific discourse and publications.\n\n4. Notably, the term 'line' has been alternately used by other terminologies and communities to refer to cultures that have been immortalized - ie has attained the capacity for indefinite propagation in vitro.  In this ontology, we refer to such cell lines as 'immortal cell lines', and use the term 'cell line' to indicate any culture that has been passaged." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Subclass axioms were: 'has grain' some 'cell line cell' and 'has grain' only 'cell line cell'\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: There is considerable ambiguity and inconsistent usage surrounding the term 'cell line' across biomedical communities. For exmaple, it can refer to the maximal collection of all cells in a cultured lineage (e.g. the colelction of all HeLa cells that exist), or to discrete portions of this maximal collection that are stored, exchanged, and applied experimentally (e.g. the dish of HeLa cells I am using in my experiment). A working group of representatives from OBI, CLO, and CL was assembled in spring of 2013 to harmonize modeling and terminology surrounding experimentally cultured cells across Open Biomedical Ontologies, following OBO Foundry principles of orthogonality and re-use. A consensus was reached to apply the term 'cell line' to refer not to a maximal collection of cells of a given type, but to discrete populations of cultured cells that share a common propagation history which has conferred a certain a genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to the population.  This meaning reflects its most common usage in domain discourse, and will best support data annotation requirements. This view means that a 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this specific history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to collections such as all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as all cells in these collections do not necessarily share a common culture history. Rather, it could be used to refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).\n\nThis approach seems to accomplish several desirable goals:\n1) It allows us to define the term 'cell line' for the community in a precise way that also reflects how the term is most commonly used in the literature and scientific discourse.\n(2) It gives a definition that provides clear criteria to help specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world\n(3) The criteria it provides demarcate populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.\n(4) The definition seems to be true to the meaning of the word 'line' - which is suggests a specific lineage of derivation." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

An additional inner structure is proposed for research objectives, qualifying them as schema:StructuredValue and combining them from two lists: research action types and research artifacts. The specific classes are subclasses of schema:ItemList. In addition, the classes for research methods, research action types and research artifacts are declared as subclasses of enumeration. Thus the typical methods, activities and research artifacts of the research area can be listed in the vocabulary itself."@en <https://bmake.th-brandenburg.de/spv> .

<http://harmonet.org/harmonise.rdfs#Gastro> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Gastro aggregated concept is the primary food and drink entity. A gastro is in one location and is managed by one organisation. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if a gastro is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple gastros. Also, if a single establishment includes two different offerings (e.g. a bar, with basic bar food, and a restaurant with a la carte gourmet offerings), this is treated as two gastros, which are related to one another.\nA gastro may consist of a restaurant, a pub, a mountain hut, a sandwich shop, or any other form of location which provides prepared food or drink for consumption on or off the premises. \n\nA gastro has much in common with an accommodation, such as a location, an organiser, etc. However, it also has many attributes of its own, particularly those which focus on the food and drink available in the gastro. \n\nThe key attributes of a gastro, which differ from those of an accommodation are \n-\tThe gastroType of the gastro \n-\tThe cuisine served (which may be primarily drink, in some cases)\n-\tThe profile values (e.g. whether or not outside catering is provided, whether picnics are allowed, etc.)\n-\tThe facility values (e.g. whether there are separate children’s dining areas, whether there is a smoking room, etc.)\nThe profile and facility values are considered as extensions to the existing (accommodation) profile and facility values." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .

<http://w3id.org/vir#> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "This ontology, called VIR, is an extension of CIDOC-CRM created to sustain propositions on the nature of visual elements and permit these descriptions to be published on the Web.\nWith the term visual element, we refer to those signs identified in the visual space as distinct and documentable units, and subject to an analytical interpretation.\nThe scope of this ontology is to s to provide a framework to support the identification, annotation and interconnections between diverse visual elements and presents and assist their documentation and retrieval. Specifically, the model aims to clarify the identity and the relation of these visual signs, providing the necessary classes to characterise their constituent elements, reference, symbolic content and source of interpretation.\nVIR expands on key entities and properties from CIDOC-CRM, introducing new classes and relationships responding to the visual and art historical community, specifically building up on the iconographical tradition. The result is a model which differentiates between interpretation and element identified, providing a clear distinction between denotation and signification of an element. As a consequence of such distinction, the ontology allows for the definition of diverse denotative criteria for the same representation, which could change based on traditions and perspective. Visual objects can be, in fact, polysemic and ambiguous, and it is not so easy to pin down a denotative or connotative meaning because they are very much context-dependent." <http://w3id.org/vir#> .

This payload itself is a JSON-LD encoded RDF class with a defined set of attributes. These attributes are either defined by RFC 7519 or by the IDS Information Model. As a direct consequence of regarding the DAT Payload as JSON-LD, *all* DAT Payloads must have exactly one \"@context\" attribute with the IDS context URI as its value and a \"@type\" with ids:DatPayload as its value. Note that, different to the DatPayload, the DatRequestPayload contains the *self-claims* of a connector and is not yet signed by any DAPS. Consequently, no other connector must accept a DatRequest object as a DAT. A DatRequest and its contained DatRequestPayload is *only* intended for interactions with a DAPS and *nothing else*!"@en <https://w3id.org/idsa/core> .
