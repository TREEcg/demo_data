<https://saref.etsi.org/saref4ener/xsdDuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This property is added to the  time:DurationDescription class to allow to express time duration also as xsd:duration. This is necessary because in the EEBus/E@h model time is always expressed as xsd:duration. We use this property to express the following time information in the EEBus/E@h model:\r\n\r\n- the startTime of the power sequence (in the PowerSequence class). SHALL be present\r\n- the endTime of the power sequence (in the PowerSequence class). If the value is available, it SHALL be denoted here. Otherwise the element SHALL be omitted.\r\n- the startTime of measurement as absolute or relative value (in the Measurement class).\r\n- the endTime of measurement as absolute or relative value (in the Measurement class).\r\n\r\nThe duration is expected to be described as in xsd:duration"@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4ener/> .
<https://w3id.org/GConsent#Processing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Processing is defined by the GDPR (Article 4-2) as \"any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\".\n\nProcessing can be considered as the action, within an activity for example, that uses data in a particular or specific way. Therefore, processing specifies what is happening to/with the data. \n\nTo define a type of processing (or its associated action), the Processing class should be subclassed for each type. Furthermore, each subclass should define a instance as a generic representative of that action. For example, \"collect\" as a type of processing (defined by the GDPR), is defined as the class DataCollection, which is a subclass of Processing, and has the individual CollectionOfPersonalData to represent a generic instance of the concept. This is to provide a ready-to-use ontology in terms of \"collect\" as an action, while also providing a way to specialise the action/processing.\nGConsent defines several such types of processing taken from the text of the GDPR."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
