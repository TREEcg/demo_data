While some personal pronouns in some languages occur in essentially the same sentence position as other nominal expressions, it is rather common for them to show distributional peculiarities.  Personal pronouns may be clitics whose distribution may be consistently distinct from that of non-clitic nominals.  It is also common for the equivalent of personal pronouns to be expressed by affixes on the verb. [Schachter 1985: 25-26]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
