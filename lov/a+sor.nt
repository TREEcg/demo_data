Typically, service providers (e.g. banks or ISPs) provide accounts to their customers or users, which are considered account owners. The existence of the account depends on the provider, even though the user owns it in some metaphoric sense. Examples could be bank, ISP, e-Commerce, ICQ, email accounts. The accounts are usually aligned with a sort of contract."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protonext> .

Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. Moreover it expresses similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons.\n\n\nExamples:\n- the Parthenon Frieze on the Acropolis in Athens (E22) shows features of the Original Parthenon Frieze in the British museum (E22). Kind of similarity: Copy (E55)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP130 (x,y) ⊃ E70(x)\nP130 (x,y) ⊃ E70(y)\nP130(x,y,z) ⊃ [P130(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\nP130(x,y) ⊃ P130(y,x)\n\nProperties: P130.1 kind of similarity: E55 Type"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
