Instances of E81 Transformation are therefore distinct from re-classifications (documented using E17 Type Assignment) or modifications (documented using E11 Modification) of objects that do not fundamentally change their nature or identity. Characteristic cases are reconstructions and repurposing of historical buildings or ruins, fires leaving buildings in ruins, taxidermy of specimen in natural history and the reorganization of a corporate body into a new one.\n\nExamples:\n- the death and mummification of Tut-Ankh-Amun (transformation of Tut-Ankh-Amun from a living person to a mummy) (E69,E81,E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE81(x) ⊃ E63(x)\nE81(x) ⊃ E64(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

In the wider sense, this class includes expressions of psychological value such as non-figural art and musical themes. However, conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E89 Propositional Object. This should not be confused with the definition of a type, which is indeed an instance of E89 Propositional Object.\n\nExamples:\n- Maxwell's Equations\n- The ideational contents of Aristotle's book entitled 'Metaphysics' as rendered in the Greek texts translated in … Oxford edition…\n- The underlying prototype of any \"no-smoking\" sign (E36)\n- The common ideas of the plots of the movie \"The Seven Samurai\" by Akira Kurosawa and the movie \"The Magnificent Seven\" by John Sturges\n- The image content of the photo of the Allied Leaders at Yalta published by UPI, 1945 (E38)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE89(x) ⊃ E28(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The distinction between corporate and personal names, which is particularly important in library applications, should be made by explicitly linking the E82 Actor Appellation to an instance of either E21 Person or E74 Group/E40 Legal Body. If this is not possible, the distinction can be made through the use of the P2 has type mechanism.\n\nExamples:\n- \"John Doe\"\n- \"Doe, J\"\n- \"the U.S. Social Security Number 246-14-2304\"\n- \"the Artist Formerly Known as Prince\"\n- \"the Master of the Flemish Madonna\"\n- \"Raphael's Workshop\"\n- \"the Brontë Sisters\"\n- \"ICOM\"\n- \"International Council of Museums\"\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE82(x) ⊃ E41(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
