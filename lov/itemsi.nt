In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a \"taxon,\" the type description as a \"protologue,\" and the exemplary specimens as \"orgininal element\" or \"holotype\".\n\nExamples:\n- creation of the taxon 'Penicillium brefeldianum B. O. Dodge' (1933)\n- addition of class E84 Information Carrier to the CIDOC CRM\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE83(x) ⊃ E65(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered \"new\" if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered \"new\" because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.\n\nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.\n\nAn event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen\n- Rembrandt's creating of the seventh state of his etching \"Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove\", 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12,E65,E81)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE12(x) ⊃ E11(x)\nE12(x) ⊃ E63(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
