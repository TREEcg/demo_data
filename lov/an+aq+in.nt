The association Intention shall link the SF_SamplingFeature to the feature which the sampling feature was designed to sample. The target of this association has the role sampledFeature with respect to the sampling feature, and shall not be a sampling feature or observation. It is usually a real-world feature from an application domain (Figures 5 and 10).\n\nEXAMPLE A profile typically samples a water- or atmospheric-column; a well samples the water in an aquifer; a tissue specimen samples a part of an organism." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/sam-lite> .
