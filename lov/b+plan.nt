<https://w3id.org/pep/Process> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The description of a process. A process generalizes the concept of `ssn:Sensing` in the SSN ontology, and of `san:Acting` in the SAN ontology. Examples of processes include sensing, acting, planning, or forecasting.\n\nIn the first version of the SSN ontology, `ssn:Process` was a subclass of `dul:Method`.\n\nA `dul:Method` is a Description that defines or uses concepts in order to guide carrying out actions aimed at a solution with respect to a problem. It is different from a Plan, because plans could be carried out in order to follow a method, but a method can be followed by executing alternative plans."@en <https://w3id.org/pep/> .
