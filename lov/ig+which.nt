There is no semantic relationship between events in the programme and TimeSlots as complex programmes often have events which ignore the published timeslots. A timeslot is effectively an event with nothing but a time interval and label.\n\nA Timeslot must have an rdfs:label and a event:time linking it to a tl:Interval.\n\nTimeslots are purely cosmetic and it is not recommended that events should not be artificially fitted into them." <http://purl.org/prog/> .
