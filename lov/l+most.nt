Most languages have phonemic contrasts between voiced and voiceless sounds (regular vibration of the vocal folds versus no vibration of the vocal folds respectively). However, Ladefoged and Maddieson recognize five steps in the continuum of modes of vibration in the glottis, going from breathy voice - the most open setting of the vocal folds in which vibration will occur, passing through slack voice, modal voice, and stiff voice, ending with creaky voice - the most constricted setting in which vibration will occur. Each of these modes of voicing may or may not be phonemic in a given language. [Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 48-49]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .

<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#MolecularInteraction> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: An interaction in which participants bind physically to each other, directly or indirectly through intermediary molecules.\n\nRationale: There is a large body of interaction data, mostly produced by high throughput systems, that does not satisfy the level of detail required to model them with ComplexAssembly class. Specifically, what is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness (closed-world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes. Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured in BioPAX using this class. \n \nUsage: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANT slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If all participants are known with exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead.\n\nExample: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid experiment where there is not enough experimental evidence to suggest that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

<http://caressesrobot.org/ontology> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:\n\n- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?\n- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? \n- Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?\n- Topics of conversation.  Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?\n\nThe CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:\n\n- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner\n- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.\n- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted person’s preferences and needs.\n\nPlease refer to the following for additional information:\n- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;\n- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.

Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.<br/><br/>\n\nThe <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:<br/><br/>\n\n1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>\n\n2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/cssSelector\">cssSelector</a> property.<br/><br/>\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/xpath\">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>\n\nFor more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this\nwe define a supporting type, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification\">SpeakableSpecification</a>  which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em> property." <http://schema.org/> .
