<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PlusClick> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "PlusClick refers to having the properties of a click.  Clicks are stops in which the essential component is the rarefaction of air enclosed between two articulatory closures formed in the oral cavity, so that a loud transient is produced when the more forward closure is released.  This uses the velaric airstream mechanism, always ingressive, and cannot be used for sounds other than stops and affricates.

E.g., the word 'share' can play both 'verb' and 'noun' roles in contemporary English, while the word 'come' can only play the 'verb' role in English, and the 'adverb' or 'conjunction' roles in Italian (but if we consider a word as only realized by phonemes, i.e. if we consider the oral realizations of 'come', there is no common word 'come' in the two languages)." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl> .
