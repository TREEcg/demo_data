This is needed to solve cases where different systems can manage metadata about a shared thing. E.g., one thing graph from BBC News may have all the politics related metadata for David Cameron, while another thing graph managed by Knowledge and Learning may contain information about the historical role David Cameron has played as a conservative leader in British politics. Separating metadata into thing graphs is useful for managing information about shared things."@en-gb <http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance> .
