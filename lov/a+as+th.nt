P45 consists of (is incorporated in) allows the different Materials to be recorded. P45 consists of (is incorporated in) refers here to observed Material as opposed to the consumed raw material.\n\nA Material, such as a theoretical alloy, may not have any physical instances.\n\nExamples:\n- silver cup 232 (E22) consists of silver (E57)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP45(x,y) ⊃ E18(x)\nP45(x,y) ⊃ E57(y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://www.onem2m.org/ontology/Base_Ontology/base_ontology#Thing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Thing in oneM2M  (Class: Thing) is an entity that can be identified in the oneM2M System. \nA Thing that is not a Device is not able to conmmunicate electronically with its environment. However, the sub-class of Thing that is able to interact electronically is called a \"Device\".\nA Thing may have ThingProperties (Object Property: hasThingProperty). A Thing can have relations to other things (Object Property: hasThingRelation).\nSince a Thing that is not a Device is not able to conmmunicate electronically it cannot influence the value of its ThingProperties or being influenced by it. Similarly a Thing cannot document its - real-world - relationships (via hasThingRelation) to other Things.\n\nE.g. A room that is modelled in oneM2M would be a Thing that could have a room-temperature as a ThingProperty and could have a relationship \"isAdjacentTo\" to another room" <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .
