<https://saref.etsi.org/core/> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Information about changes compared to version 1.1.1:\n - The classes and properties related to how to represent devices in building spaces (such as the saref:BuildingSpace class,  saref:BuildingObject class and saref:isLocatedIn property) have been removed from SAREF and incorporated  into the SAREF4BLDG extension related to buildings, including the reuse of the W3C? WGS84 geo positioning vocabulary.\n - The saref:DeviceCategory and saref:FunctionCategory classes have been removed. Instead, the hierarchy of device categories has been implemented directly as subclasses of the saref:Device class.\n - The information specific for energy efficiency has been moved to the SAREF4ENER extension. For example, the saref:Profile class has been redefined to accommodate only the properties that are general enough for any type of profile, not only for energy and power. Details on how to specifically model a power profile can be found in the SAREF4ENER extension. \n - The subclasses of the saref:Energy class  have been removed (i.e., Average Energy, Maximum Energy, Minimum Energy, Total Energy, HVAC Energy, Hot Water Energy and Lighting Energy).\n - The saref:Property class has been split into two classes (saref:Property and saref:Measurement), as it is done in the SAREF4ENVI extension, in order to properly accommodate the distinction between the concept of property (an observable quality of something) and the concept of measurement (a concrete value observed for a property).\n - Too restrictive cardinality restrictions have been revised, sometimes making them optional rather than mandatory (better to make properties mandatory in the extensions that specialize SAREF for a specific purpose, rather than restricting SAREF, whose purpose is more general). For example, definitions of units of measurement using an enumeration (owl:oneOf) were too restrictive because they did not allow using other units than those enumerated. Therefore, the individuals of each class are still there, but the owl:oneOf enumeration has been removed.\n - The saref:UnitOfMeasure subclasses use individuals from the OM ontology for unit of measures, but this is not the only solution. It has been clarified in the comments that the OM ontology is an example, but other ontologies can be used.\n - The global restrictions (rdfs:domain and rdfs:range) in object properties have been completely removed not to hinder interoperability. Object properties are now only restricted locally in the classes. \n - The subclasses of saref:Task have been transormed in individuals.\n - The saref:hasTask property has been removed from the saref:Profile class to resolve an ambiguity with the saref:Task class." <https://saref.etsi.org/core/> .

This affects saref:hasDescription, saref:hasManufacturer, saref:hasModel and saref:hasName, which now have implicitly a range of rdfs:Literal.\n - The saref:hasName property has been removed and the use of rdfs:label is recommended. \n - The saref:hasDescription property has been deprecated and the use of rdfs:comment is recommended. \n - Too restrictive restrictions have been removed and in some cases the ontology documentation has been updated to reflect this: a saref:Command having at most one saref:hasDescription; a saref:Task being accomplished by at least one saref:Device; a saref:Device having a typical consumption of only energy or power; a saref:Commodity being measured in units of measure; restrictions on the values of saref:accomplishes that only covered specific use cases; universal restrictions on the saref:actsUpon property have been changed to existential ones; restrictions on the commands that a saref:Function may have, since there could be others not included in the defined enumerations; restrictive documentation of saref:EventFunction and saref:SmokeSensor.\n - Bugs have been fixed: some devices (saref:DoorSwitch, saref:EnergyMeter, saref:LigthSwitch, saref:SmokeSensor, and saref:TemperatureSensor) were defined as subclass of a device and at the same time as consisting of such device; a saref:LightSwitch controls light and does not measure light, since it is an actuator; incorrect documentation of saref:OnState and saref:OffState.\n - The saref:BuildingRelated, saref:EnergyRelated and saref:FunctionRelated classes have been removed, since the different extensions already classify the device types.\n - The instances of the subclasses of saref:Command have been removed, since they represent examples.\n - The instances of saref:UnitOfMeasure have been moved to examples.\n - The classes related to the SAREF4ENER extension have been removed: saref:Generator, saref:Storage, saref:Load and saref:EnergyMeter.\n - Some instances of saref:Device have been moved to examples: saref:WashingMachine, saref:LightingDevice, saref:MicroRenewable, saref:Multimedia, and saref:Network.\n - Added domain and range axioms wherever the definition of a property unambiguously identifies the domain or the range of the property.\n - The OWL Time ontology is not imported anymore.\n - The documentation of some ontology terms has been updated for clarification.\n - Language tags have been added to all labels and comments.\n" <https://saref.etsi.org/core/> .

<http://data.businessgraph.io/ontology#> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The euBusinessGraph (`ebg:`) ontology represents companies, type/status/economic classification, addresses, identifiers, company officers (e.g., directors and CEOs), and dataset offerings.\n\nIt uses `schema:domainIncludes/rangeIncludes` (which are polymorphic) to describe which properties are applicable to a class, \nrather than `rdfs:domain/range` (which are monomorphic) to prescribe what classes must be applied to each node using a property.\nWe find that this enables more flexible reuse and combination of different ontologies.\nWe reuse the following ontologies and nomenclatures, and extend them where appropriate with classes and properties:\n\n- W3C Org, W3C RegOrg (basic company data), \n\n- W3C Time (officer membership), \n\n- W3C Locn (addresses),\n\n- schema.org (domain/rangeIncludes and various properties)\n\n- DBpedia ontology (jurisdiction)\n\n- NGEO and Spatial (NUTS administrative divisions)\n\n- ADMS (identifiers), \n\n- FOAF, SIOC (blog posts),\n\n- RAMON, SKOS (NACE economic classifications and various nomenclatures),\n\n- VOID (dataset descriptions).\n\nThis is only a reference. See more detail in the [EBG Semantic Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhMOTlIOC6dOK_jksJRX0CB-GIRoiYY6fWtCnZArUhU/edit) google document, which includes an informative description of classes and properties, gives examples and data provider rules, and provides more schema and instance diagrams.\n\n## Overview\nThe figure below gives an overview of the ontology, depicting the main classes and their relationships (i.e., object properties). The ontology covers the following areas:\n\n- Registered Organization: To represent a legal company.\n\n- Identifier System: To represent Identifier Systems. A company can have several Identifiers belonging to different Identifier Systems.\n\n- Officer: To represent associated company officers, e.g., directors.\n\n- Dataset: To represent information about datasets that are offered by company data providers.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-overview.png)\n\n### Registered Organization (company)\nRegistered organizations are the main entities for which information is captured in the euBusinessGraph ontology. The ontology is not concerned with unregistered informal groups. Registered organizations gain legal entity status by the act of registration and are distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in some jurisdictions, sole traders. The figure below shows the classes and properties for representing core data about a registered organization.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-company-classes.png)\n\n### Identifier System\nMechanisms to identify companies in various data sources are essential in integration of data about companies across data sources. A proper understanding of what kind of systems of identifiers can be used for companies is thus necessary in this context. We analyzed various types of identifiers commonly used for companies and collected various properties of the systems they are part of. We modelled identifiers and identifier systems explicitly in the ontology as shown in thew figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-identifier-classes.png)\n\n### Officer\nWe use the membership model of the W3C Organization Ontology in a straightforward way to represent officer data as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-officer-classes.png)\n\n### Dataset Descriptions\nData consumers need to know how many companies are included in a data provider dataset, from which jurisdictions, and what depth of data is included (e.g., which properties, addresses with what geo resolution, etc.). We thus need to express both metadata about the dataset itself, and fine-grained statistics about the content of a dataset, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-dataset-classes.png)\n\n" <http://data.businessgraph.io/ontology#> .
