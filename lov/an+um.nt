<http://umbel.org/umbel#correspondsTo> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The property umbel:correspondsTo is used to assert a close correspondence between an external class, named entity, individual or instance with a Reference Concept class. umbel:correspondsTo relates the external class, named entity, individual or instance to the class through the basis of both its subject matter and intended scope. This predicate should be used where the correspondence between the two entities is felt to be nearly equivalent to a sameAs assertion, and is reflexive, but without the full entailments of intensional class memberships. In these cases, both entities are understood to have the same type and intended scope, but without asserting a full class-level or sameAs individual relationship.\n\nThis predicate is designed for the circumstance of aligning two different ontologies or knowledge bases based on node-level correspondences, but without entailing the actual ontological relationships and structure of the object source. For example, the umbel:correspondsTo predicate is used to assert close correspondence between UMBEL Reference Concepts and Wikipedia categories or pages, yet without entailing the actual Wikipedia category structure.\n\nThis property asserts a different and stronger relationship than umbel:isAbout. One practical use is to guide specific instance member determinations when, say, the native structure of the external ontology or knowledge base is to be analyzed and replaced with an UMBEL-based structure.\n\nThis property is therefore used to create a nearly equivalent assertion (however, with the degree of that equivalence being unknown or unknowable) between an external instance or class and a Reference Concept class"@en <http://umbel.org/umbel> .

<http://www.w3.org/ns/regorg#RegisteredOrganization> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "rov:RegisteredOrganization is the key class for the Registered Organization vocabulary and represents \n    an organization that is legally registered. In many countries there is a single registry although in others, such \n    as Spain and Germany, multiple registries exist. A Registered Organization is able to trade, is legally liable for \n    its actions, accounts, tax affairs etc. Legal entity status is conferred by the act of registration cf. \n    org:FormalOrganization that applies to any legal entity, including those created by other legal means.\n    This makes registered organizations distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in \n    some jurisdictions, sole traders. Many organizations exist that are not legal entities yet to the outside world \n    they have staff, hierarchies, locations etc. Other organizations exist that are an umbrella for several legal entities \n    (universities are often good examples of this). This vocabulary is concerned solely with registered organizations.\n    In RDF, Registered Organization is a sub class of the Organization Ontology's org:FormalOrganization which is itself a \n    sub class of the more general 'Agent' class found in FOAF and Dublin Core that does encompass organizations, \n    natural persons, groups etc. - i.e. an Agent is any entity that is able to carry out actions.</p>"@en <http://www.w3.org/ns/regorg> .
