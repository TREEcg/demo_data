As students began using the data released by universities to help choose a college, he reasoned, universities would feel compelled to improve their teaching practices in order to attract the best applicants.\" The idea is that with the hasTeachingMethod-property universities can start publishing the teaching methods they use as Linked Open Data. Let us see which university implements the idea first."@en <http://linkedscience.org/teach/ns#> .
