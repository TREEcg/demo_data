<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#SmallMolecule> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A pool of molecules that are neither complexes nor are genetically encoded.\n\nRationale: Identity of small molecules are based on structure, rather than sequence as in the case of DNA, RNA or Protein. A small molecule reference is a grouping of several small molecule entities  that have the same chemical structure.  \n\nUsage : Smalle Molecules can have a cellular location and binding features. They can't have modification features as covalent modifications of small molecules are not considered as state changes but treated as different molecules.\nSome non-genomic macromolecules, such as large complex carbohydrates are currently covered by small molecules despite they lack a static structure. Better coverage for such molecules require representation of generic stoichiometry and polymerization, currently planned for BioPAX level 4.\n\nExamples: glucose, penicillin, phosphatidylinositol" <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

For example,  ser46 phosphorylated p53 is a physical entity in BioPAX defined by the p53 sequence and the phosphorylation feature on the serine at position 46 in the sequence.  Features are any combination of cellular location, covalent and non-covalent bonds with other molecules and covalent modifications.  \n\nFor a specific molecule to be a member of the pool it has to satisfy all of the specified features. Unspecified features are treated as unknowns or unneccesary. Features that are known to not be on the molecules should be explicitly stated with the \"not feature\" property. \nA physical entity in BioPAX  never represents a specific molecular instance. \n\nPhysical Entity can be heterogenous and potentially overlap, i.e. a single molecule can be counted as a member of multiple pools. This makes BioPAX semantics different than regular chemical notation but is necessary for dealing with combinatorial complexity. \n\nSynonyms: part, interactor, object, species\n\nExamples: extracellular calcium, ser 64 phosphorylated p53" <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
