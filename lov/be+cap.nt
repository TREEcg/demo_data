<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E13_Attribute_Assignment> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises the actions of making assertions about properties of an object or any relation between two items or concepts.\n\nThis class allows the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as \"short cuts\" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.\n\nIn particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.\n\nExamples:\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr's silver cup in February 1997\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE13(x) âŠƒ E7(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

A Device contains some logic and is producer and/or consumer of data that are exchanged via its Services with other oneM2M entities (Devices, Things) in the network. A Device may be a physical or non-physical entity.\nIn the context of oneM2M a Device is always assumed to be capable of communicating electronically via a network.\n - In order to accomplish its task, the device performs one or more functionalities \n - These functionalities are exposed in the network as Services of the Device.\n - A Device can be composed of several (sub-) Devices \n - Each Device (including sub-Devices) needs to be individually addressable in the network." <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .

<https://w3id.org/GConsent#MinorDataSubject> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Minor is a Data Subject who cannot provide their own consent (that is legally valid). Therefore, their consent must be obtained via a Guardian or Legal Representative or Parent. Minor is a subclass of Data Subject.\n\nConsent given in lieu of a Minor (by their Representative) is associated with the `ConsentInstance` class/instance using the `wasGivenBy` property.\n\nThe ontology currently does not capture this relationship between the Minor and their Representative. This is due to required clarifications regarding how this role should be represented. For example, the `DataSubject` cannot be subclassed to create a `Representative` class, as this would make the `DataSubject` a permanent representative for the Minor. Instead, the role of 'acting as representative' is only for the instance of the given consent. Therefore, this could be represented with a `ConsentRepresentativeRole` class that links to the `MinorDataSubject` with `roleHadDataSubject` property, and the `DataSubject` that gave the consent via the `roleHadRepresentative` property. The relationship or reason or situation of this given consent can be captured by further annotating the `ConsentRepresentativeRole` instance. This approach can also be extended to other similar situations where one `DataSubject` gives consent in lieu of another.\n\nNote: A Minor can provide their own consent in certain cases, or conversely, a minor's consent may need to be provided by a 'parental' representative in some cases."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
