The result\nshall be expressed as the number of students per teacher.\n\nPrivate educational facilities shall not be included in the\nstudent/teacher ratio.\n\nOne part-time student enrolment shall be counted as one full-time\nenrolment; in other words a student who attends school for half a day\nshould be counted as a full-time enrolment. If a city reports full-time\nequivalent (FTE) enrolment (where two half day students equal one full\nstudent enrolment), this shall be noted. \n\nThe number of classroom teachers and other instructional staff (e.g.\nteachersâ€™ aides, guidance counsellors), shall not include administrators\nor other non-teaching staff. Kindergarten or pre-school teachers and\nstaff shall not be included. \n\nThe number of teachers shall be counted in fifth time increments, for\nexample, a teacher working one day per week should be counted as 0,2\nteachers, and a teacher working three days a week should be counted as\n0,6 teachers."@en <http://ontology.eil.utoronto.ca/ISO37120.owl> .
