<http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite#Process> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#historyNote> "Original description from ISO 19156 says: \r\n\r\nThe class OM_Process (Figure 2) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType (ISO 19109:2005), which therefore represents a feature type. OM_Process is abstract, and has no attributes, operations or associations. It serves as the base class for observation processes. The purpose of an observation process is to generate an observation result. An instance of OM_Process is often an instrument or sensor, but may be a human observer, a simulator, or a process or algorithm applied to more primitive results used as inputs. \r\n\r\nNOTE\tISO 19115-2:2008 provides MI_Instrument, LE_Processing and LE_Algorithm, which could all be modelled as specializations of OM_Process. OGC SensorML [10] provides a model which is suitable for many observation procedures." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite> .

<http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite#Process> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#historyNote> "Original description from OGC SensorML says:\r\n\r\nIn SensorML, all components are modeled as processes. This includes components normally viewed as hardware, including transducers, actuators, and processors (which are viewed as process components) and sensors and platforms (which are modeled as systems). All components are modeled as processes that take input, and which through the application of an algorithm defined by a method and parameter values, generate output. All such components can therefore participate in process chains. Process chains are themselves processes with inputs, outputs, and parameters.\r\n\r\nHence, SensorML can be viewed as a specialized process description language with an emphasis on application to sensor data. Process descriptions in SensorML are agnostic of the development environment in which they might be executed, or the protocol by which data is transported between process execution modules. SensorML does not try to replace other existing technologies (such as BPEL or MATLAB Simulink). It is also conceived that SensorML-defined processes could be imported and executed within other execution environments, such as BPEL or MATLAB Simulink, as well as within SenosrML-enabled process execution software." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite> .

<http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/muo#SimpleDerivedUnit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Units that are derived from exactly one base unit. There are two main possibilities. On one hand, there are units that are derived by adding a prefix to the unit. The prefix is a name or associated symbol (e.g. kilo) that precedes a unit of measure (e.g. meter) to form a decimal multiple or submultiple (e.g. Kilometer). Derived units, obtained by the application of a prefix, measure the same physical quality as its base unit. On the other hand, there are another kind of simple derived units that are also obtained from exactly one base unit but they measure a different physical quality. They are obtained by changing the exponent of the unit in the dimensional equation. For instance, this is how square meters are derived from meters. This exponent is represented in MUO with the datatype property muo:dimensionalSize. Combining this two patterns we can represent units that are obtained from a prefix and that have a dimension size different from 1, for instance, the unit square kilometer."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .
