<http://purl.org/query/voidext#VirtualLinkSet> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A set of virtual links between two datasets. A virtual link is a connection between resources such as literals and instances with some commonality. Each of these resources is from a different RDF dataset. A resource mapping can be also considered when defining common resources between datasets. For example, the datasets uses different prefix namespaces for similar instances in a given domain scope. A virtual link can be interpreted as an intersection data point between two datasets. In addition, a virtual link is not concretely stored. The link may be physically established during a federated query execution, for example. This class must only have instances of its subclasses. It is recommendable to comment (rdfs:comment) the scope of the virtual link set."@en <http://purl.org/query/voidext> .
