This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Collection often referred to with the name of the E78 Collection (e.g. \"The Wallace Collection decided…\").\n\nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Collection. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.\n\nExamples:\n- The John Clayton Herbarium\n- the Wallace Collection\n- Mikael Heggelund Foslie's coralline red algae Herbarium at Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE78(x) ⊃ E24(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\n\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring\n- the place referred to in the phrase: \"Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone\"\n- here -> <-\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE53(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
