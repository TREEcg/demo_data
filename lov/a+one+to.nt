<http://harmonet.org/harmonise.rdfs#Gastro> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Gastro aggregated concept is the primary food and drink entity. A gastro is in one location and is managed by one organisation. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if a gastro is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple gastros. Also, if a single establishment includes two different offerings (e.g. a bar, with basic bar food, and a restaurant with a la carte gourmet offerings), this is treated as two gastros, which are related to one another.\nA gastro may consist of a restaurant, a pub, a mountain hut, a sandwich shop, or any other form of location which provides prepared food or drink for consumption on or off the premises. \n\nA gastro has much in common with an accommodation, such as a location, an organiser, etc. However, it also has many attributes of its own, particularly those which focus on the food and drink available in the gastro. \n\nThe key attributes of a gastro, which differ from those of an accommodation are \n-\tThe gastroType of the gastro \n-\tThe cuisine served (which may be primarily drink, in some cases)\n-\tThe profile values (e.g. whether or not outside catering is provided, whether picnics are allowed, etc.)\n-\tThe facility values (e.g. whether there are separate childrenâ€™s dining areas, whether there is a smoking room, etc.)\nThe profile and facility values are considered as extensions to the existing (accommodation) profile and facility values." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .

An accommodation is in one location and is managed by an organiser. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if an accommodation is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple accommodations.\nAn accommodation may consist of a hotel, or a bed and breakfast, or a pension, or any other form of accommodation which provides private-room, catered services to guests. The self-catering and camping sectors are excluded from the scope of the accommodation concept. However, the accommodation ontology is structured in such a way as to facilitate the broadening of the sub domain in the future. \n\nAn accommodation is made up of a number of units (often bedrooms). The accommodation has facilities which are available on a per-accommodation basis (accommodation-level facilities), such as a swimming pool or car park. The units also have facilities, which are available on a per-unit basis (unit-level facilities), such as hair-dryers." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .
