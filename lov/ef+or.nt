<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Belief> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A belief is what an agent believes (which may be true or not in the world) In\n            the BDI model, beliefs form the agent's knowledge about the world that the agent\n            relies on for devising plans to achieve her goals. In Drammar there is no distinction\n            between knowing and believing, because reasoning concerns the agent motivations for\n            acting, rather than the relationship between single agent knowledge and shared\n            knowledge. A belief is formally defined as the type of MentalState described by a\n            BeliefSchema. In the annotation, it is in the scope a ConsistenStateSet, that is\n            precondition or effect of a Plan. SWRL rules for mapping project a belief onto some\n            ConsistentStateSet which precedes or follows a timeline." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
