Converbal constructions are generally not arguments but modifiers, and they generally modify verbs, clauses or sentences, but not nouns or noun phrases. They are embedded or incorporated into the superordinate clause, and contrast with coordinate constructions. Converbal constructions can often be paraphrased by means of coordinate constructions in languages that allow coordination of clauses, such as in the gloss for the Korean example below.
