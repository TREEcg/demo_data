It can be either dynamic - like in \"drawing a circle\", or static - like in \"being a president\". In all cases, a happening (an event, a situation, or a time period) has a certain (usually quite concrete) temporal positioning - in the simplest case it is the one, denoted by start and end point in time."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .

In being defined in this way, this class can be used to refer to the populations that researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history. Cultured cell populations represent only a collection of cells (ie do not include media, culture dishes, etc), and include populations of cultured unicellular organisms or cultured multicellular organism cells. They can exist under active culture, stored in a quiescent state for future use, or applied experimentally." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .
