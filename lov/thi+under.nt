Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a reproducible expression.\n\nExamples:\n- image BM000038850.JPG from the Clayton Herbarium in London\n- E. A. Poe's \"The Raven\"\n- the movie \"The Seven Samurai\" by Akira Kurosawa\n- the Maxwell Equations\n- The Getty AAT as published as Linked Open Data, accessed 1/10/2014\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE73(x) ⊃ E89(x)  \nE73(x) ⊃ E90(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

This class represents an individual production equipment device and includes their specification in terms of functions, states and services. Different types of machines can be defined under this class as needed, for example, LaserCuttingMachine (i.e., a type of production equipment to cut steel material), MillingMachine (i.e., to drill holes in steel material), MouldingMachine (i.e., to mold liquid material, such as iron or plastic, and let it harden in a certain shape), WeldingMachine (i.e., join parts of material, such as steel, together), etc." <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4inma/> .
