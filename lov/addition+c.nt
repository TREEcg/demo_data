For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.\n\nThe class E36 Visual Item provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Man-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks or images etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Man-Made Thing and depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a short-cut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.\n\nExamples:\n- the visual appearance of Monet's \"La Pie\" (E38)\n- the Coca-Cola logo (E34)\n- the Chi-Rho (E37)\n- the communist red star (E37)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE36(x) âŠƒ E73(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The content of the addition complement distribution of dataset B should be added to the entire content of dataset A to form dataset B. When the dataset B is the result of both additions and deletions on dataset A, dataset B should have a direct distribution with two subdistributions (cdc:hasSubDistribution): one containing triples to be deleted (cdc:DeletetionDistribution) from the source dataset and another containing triples that should be added (cdc:AdditionDistribution) to the source dataset."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .
