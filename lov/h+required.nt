<http://schema.org/EndorsementRating> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement, for example inclusion in a \"critic's pick\" blog, a\n\"Like\" or \"+1\" on a social network. It can be considered the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/result\">result</a> of an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/EndorseAction\">EndorseAction</a> in which the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/object\">object</a> of the action is rated positively by\nsome <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/agent\">agent</a>. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/Action\">Action</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nAn <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/EndorsementRating\">EndorsementRating</a> may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,\nendorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive." <http://schema.org/> .
