Phonetically, they are sounds articulated without a complete closure in the mouth that would produce a stop or a degree of narrowing that would create audible friction; the air escapes evenly over the center of the tongue. For oral vowels, air escapes solely through the mouth. If some air is simultaneously released through the nose, the vowel is nasal. The quality of the vowel sound is affected by the shape of the oral resonance chamber, chiefly influenced by the position of the lips and the position of the tongue.
