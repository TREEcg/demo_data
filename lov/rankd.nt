It was equivalent to the rank of Private. The rank was initially used in the Royal Artillery for the men who drove the teams of horses which pulled the guns. It was phased out after the First World War (when all Royal Artillerymen of the lowest rank were redesignated as Gunners). It was also used in the Royal Australian Artillery and Royal Canadian Artillery."@en <http://rdf.muninn-project.org/ontologies/military> .
