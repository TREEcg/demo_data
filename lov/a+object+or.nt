A Process Executor may be a physical device, a computational method, a web service, a laboratory setup with a person following a method, or any other thing that can follow a Process. This concept generalizes ssn:Sensor, which in the latest version of the SSN ontology is a subclass of dul:Object. A dul:Object is any physical, social, or mental object, or a substance.\n\nPrototypical process executors are Sensor, Actuator, Estimator.\n\nLinks to ProcessExecution describe the Executions made.\n\nLinks to Processes define how the executor can make Executions (it may implement several Processes). A Process Executor implements each of the methods used by the Executions it made. \n\nOther metadata may detail geolocation, vendor, operator, consumed power, etc."@en <https://w3id.org/pep/> .
