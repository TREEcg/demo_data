It is the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure and water content to reach saturation. A higher dew point indicates more moisture in the air; a dew point greater than 20 Degree C (68 Degree F) is considered uncomfortable and greater than 22 Degree C (72 Degree F) is considered to be extremely humid."@en <http://purl.org/iot/vocab/m3-lite#> .
