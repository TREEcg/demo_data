<http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo#SupportVectorMachines> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples into one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall on.\n\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces."@en <http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo> .

An additional inner structure is proposed for research objectives, qualifying them as schema:StructuredValue and combining them from two lists: research action types and research artifacts. The specific classes are subclasses of schema:ItemList. In addition, the classes for research methods, research action types and research artifacts are declared as subclasses of enumeration. Thus the typical methods, activities and research artifacts of the research area can be listed in the vocabulary itself."@en <https://bmake.th-brandenburg.de/spv> .
