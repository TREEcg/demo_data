The approach for this subontology is to have a hierarchy of location classes, such that instances of the classes further down in the hierarchy can be contained in instances of the classes higher up in the hierarchy. On each level, there exist two sister classes: class L defines a certain type of location, while class SubL defines locations which can be contained in instances of L. SubL then defines a property inL, to express which instance of L an instance of SubL is contained in. E.g. for a class Continent, there exists a class SubContinent. All children of SubContinent (either direct or transitive) define locations that can be contained in a continent, such as countries, regions, cities, etc. By virtue of inheritance, all these location classes then have a property inContinent, to express that they are contained in some continent. In a simpler, flat structure, inContinent would have to be defined explicitly for all kinds of locations that can be contained in a continent.\nThe intepretation of the inL predicates should be as follows: if, for a particular instance K, inL has a value, this value is valid. If inL has no value, the value of inL in the next location K is contained in valid, and so forth. E.g. an instance \"Hawaii\" has the value \"Oceania\" defined for <link>inContinent</link> and \"USA\" for <link>inCountry</link>. \"Delaware\" has no value for inContinent. \"USA\" has the value \"North America\" for <link>inContinent</link>. The interpretation would be that \"Hawaii\" is located in \"Oceania\", while \"Delaware\" is located in \"North America\".\nWe are aware of the fact that this approach is idealized and can therefore conflict with reality in some situations. E.g., the exact borders of continents are not always defined (there are contradicting opinions on where exactly Europe begins or ends). Countries could be contained in more than one continent (Turkey belongs to both Europe and Asia). However, we think that these situations are marginal and have little or no impact on the intended use of this ontology.\nWe think that this recursive modelling of locations is at the same time simple and powerful enough to capture all necessary aspects of the concept of location for a domain such as an SWPortal. While the SubL classes might appear to be somewhat artificial, they are actually not. They are just an abstraction for geographical entities that are (under normal circumstances) smaller than entities of type L. As such, they are no more abstract than, say, the concept of an agent.\n" <http://sw-portal.deri.org/ontologies/swportal> .

This predicate should be used where the correspondence between the two entities is felt to be nearly equivalent to a sameAs assertion, and is reflexive, but without the full entailments of intensional class memberships. In these cases, both entities are understood to have the same type and intended scope, but without asserting a full class-level or sameAs individual relationship.\n\nThis predicate is designed for the circumstance of aligning two different ontologies or knowledge bases based on node-level correspondences, but without entailing the actual ontological relationships and structure of the object source. For example, the umbel:correspondsTo predicate is used to assert close correspondence between UMBEL Reference Concepts and Wikipedia categories or pages, yet without entailing the actual Wikipedia category structure.\n\nThis property asserts a different and stronger relationship than umbel:isAbout. One practical use is to guide specific instance member determinations when, say, the native structure of the external ontology or knowledge base is to be analyzed and replaced with an UMBEL-based structure.\n\nThis property is therefore used to create a nearly equivalent assertion (however, with the degree of that equivalence being unknown or unknowable) between an external instance or class and a Reference Concept class"@en <http://umbel.org/umbel> .

Research objects might aggregate a wfdesc:Workflow, a wfdesc:WorkflowDefinition, or (recommended) both.\n\nA wfdesc:Workflow defines associated wfdesc:Process using wfdesc:hasSubProcess. A specialisation of this property is wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow, signifying that the process is a wfdesc:Workflow itself, which is further described in a similar fashion.\n\nAs a subclass of wfdesc:Process a wfdesc:Workflow can also define wfdesc:hasInput/wfdesc:hasOutput parameters - these would be inputs taken at workflow execution time, and final outputs of the workflow. (Note: Not all dataflow systems have this concept of workflow parameters)\n\nwfdesc:Parameter descriptions are linked using wfdesc:DataLink descriptions associated with the wfdesc:Workflow using wfdesc:hasDataLink.\n\nA wfdesc:Parameter defined with wfdesc:hasInput on a wfdesc:Workflow is considered an wfdesc:Input \"outside\" the workflow (ie. if it is a subworkflow), but an wfdesc:Output \"inside\" the workflow (where it can be connected to a wfdesc:Input of a wfdesc:Process). Thus such parameters can be linked \"through\" the workflow without having a \"mirrored\" port inside.\n\n\nExample:\n\n```\n@prefix wfdesc: <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#> .\n:outerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow :innerWorkflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubProcess :procA, :procC .\n\n:procA a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param1 .\n\n:procC a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param2 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param3 .\n\n\n:innerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param4 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param5 ;\n  wfdesc:hasProcess :procB .\n\n:procB a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param6 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param7 .\n\n:innerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param4; wfdesc:hasSink :param6 ],\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param7; wfdesc:hasSink :param5 ] .\n\n:outerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param1; wfdesc:hasSink :param4 ],\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param5; wfdesc:hasSink :param2 ] .\n```\n\n\nIn this example :param1 is the output of :procA. :param1 is the source in a datalink that goes to the input :param4 of the :innerWorkflow. :param4 is however also the source of an inner datalink, going to input :param6 of the nested :procB.\n\nFrom this :param4 is both an wfdesc:Input and wfdesc:Output (which is why these two classes are not disjoint)"@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc> .
