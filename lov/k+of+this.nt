Papers of this kind may contain a selective bibliography listing key papers related to the subject or providing advice on information sources, or they may strive to be comprehensive, covering all contributions to the development of a topic and exploring their different findings or views.\n\nE.g. see http://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/products/journals/author_guidelines.htm?id=JD"@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .

The results of this kind of actions are considered new works, and not mere reproductions, because they contribute something new, i.e. they are original as detailed in the Originality section. This right is concretised into the Adaptation Right and the Translation Right. The former creates a new work of a different type than the original one, e.g. a film from a novel. The latter generates a work of the same type but in a different language."@en <http://rhizomik.net/ontologies/copyrightonto.owl> .
