<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Timeline> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Timeline Timeline is a subclass of List whose function is to impose some\n            ordering on the units in a drama. Notice that the notion of timeline cannot be collapsed\n            onto the actual text: rather, it is simply an indexing posed upon units (which\n            correspond to a manifestation of drama in FRBR sense). In formal terms, the orders\n            object property has Timeline as its domain and units as its range, so a unit\n            \"orders\" some units. A Timeline contains unit. Formally, the elements\n            (OrderedListElements class) contained in a timeline (containsOLE property) are units. A\n            Timeline is surrounded by states of affairs that hold before and after it, namely\n            instances of the ConsistentSateSets class that precede and follow a given timeline.\n            Formally, the Timeline class is the domain of the hasTimelineEffect(Precondition)\n            properties, which have the ConsistentStateSet class as their range. A timeline is\n            motivated by some plan (motivates object property) and is spanned by some unit (span\n            object property). The relation between units and timelines is independent of the\n            scene/timeline relation." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

A quantity is always associated with the context of measurement (i.e. the thing measured, the measured value, the accuracy of measurement, etc.) whereas the underlying <b>quantity kind</b> is independent of any particular measurement. Thus, length is a quantity kind while the height of a rocket is a specific quantity of length; its magnitude that may be expressed in meters, feet, inches, etc. Examples of physical quantities include physical constants, such as the speed of light in a vacuum, Planck's constant, the electric permittivity of free space, and the fine structure constant. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lm-para\">In other words, quantities are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as the duration of a movie, the distance between two points, velocity of a car, the pressure of the atmosphere, and a person's weight; and units are used to describe their numerical measure. \r\n\r\n<p class=\"lm-para\">Many <b>quantity kinds</b> are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result, the associated units of some quantity kinds can be expressed as products (or ratios) of powers of other quantity kinds (e.g., momentum is mass times velocity and velocity is defined as distance divided by time). In this way, some quantities can be calculated from other measured quantities using their associations to the quantity kinds in these expressions. These quantity kind relationships are also discussed in dimensional analysis. Those that cannot be so expressed can be regarded as \"fundamental\" in this sense.</p>\r\n<p class=\"lm-para\">A quantity is distinguished from a \"quantity kind\" in that the former carries a value and the latter is a type specifier.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
