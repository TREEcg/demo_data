A continuation of an activity may happen when the continued activity is still ongoing or after the continued activity has completely ended. The continuing activity may have started already before it decided to continue the other one. Continuation implies a coherence of intentions and outcomes of the involved activities.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral) (E7), abandoned in the 15th century, was continued by construction in the 19th century adapting the initial plans so as to preserve the intended appearance (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP134(x,y) ⊃ E7(x)\nP134(x,y)⊃ E7(y)\nP134(x,y) ⊃ P15(x,y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
