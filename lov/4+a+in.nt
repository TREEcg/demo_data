Examples include extended events like a football match or a race, actions like pursuing and reading, and biological processes. The formal definition is: anything that occurs in time but is not an object. Note that a process may have participants 'inside' it which are objects, such as the players in a football match. In a 4D ontology, a process is something whose spatiotemporal extent is thought of as dividing into temporal stages roughly perpendicular to the time-axis.
