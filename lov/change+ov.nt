CDC predefines three instances of this class, i.e. cdc:incoming, cdc:internal and cdc:outgoing. Each catalog, dataset, distribution or data service can only have one tag that is not supposed to change over the lifetime of the described resource unless it considers a dataset (that is not a catalog). When necessary, qualified relations between DCAT entities can also get a tag."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .
