<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl#Word> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A linguistic object consisting of a string (independently of its physical realization).\nIts topological unity can change according to its physical realization: as a written realization, its boundaries are blank spaces, as a spoken realization, sometimes is silence, sometimes not, and higher order features intervene.\nGrammatical notions, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., are roles defined by a grammar, and words (or larger linguistic objects) can play those roles in a given language. E.g., the word 'share' can play both 'verb' and 'noun' roles in contemporary English, while the word 'come' can only play the 'verb' role in English, and the 'adverb' or 'conjunction' roles in Italian (but if we consider a word as only realized by phonemes, i.e. if we consider the oral realizations of 'come', there is no common word 'come' in the two languages)." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl> .

ISO defines them in three separate standards. However, their interaction has been poorly studied, so far. The SQuAP model (Software Quality, Architecture, Process) describes twenty-eight main factors that impact on software quality in banking systems, and each factor is described as a relation among some characteristics from the three ISO standards. Hence, SQuAP makes such relations emerge rigorously, although informally. SQaAP-Ont is an OWL ontology that formalises those relations in order to represent and reason via Linked Data about software engineering in a three-dimensional model consisting of quality, architecture, and process characteristics." <https://w3id.org/squap/> .
