P7took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (generally on the surface of the earth).  For example, the period \"Révolution française\" can be said to have taken place in \"France\", the \"Victorian\" period, may be said to have taken place in \"Britain\" and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and north America.\nA period can take place at multiple locations.\nIt is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place.

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#UnderspecifiedPlan> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An UnderspecifiedPlan is a plan that is part of a larger plan to achieve some\n            goal, but has not been executed. In drama, it represents the unobservable part of a plan\n            that has not been fully carried out by some agent. Its existence (in the agent's\n            mind) can only be conjectured - remember that a Plan is intended by some agent by\n            definition. As the object of a conjecture, it does not contain any details in the\n            representation of drama (this does not mean that it does not contain them in the\n            agent's mind). As such, an UnderspecifiedPlan: - does *not* motivate a timeline (it\n            has not taken place); - does *not* achieve a goal (the actions/subplans composing it and\n            its specific goal are not known); - does *not* contain any actions. These conditions,\n            part of its definition as an Equivalent Class, distinguish it from Abstract and Directly\n            Executable Plans." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
