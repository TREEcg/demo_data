However, what constitutes a unit of thought is subjective, and this definition is meant to be suggestive, rather than restrictive.\n\nThe notion of a SKOS concept is useful when describing the conceptual or intellectual structure of a knowledge organization system, and when referring to specific ideas or meanings established within a KOS.\n\nNote that, because SKOS is designed to be a vehicle for representing semi-formal KOS, such as thesauri and classification schemes, a certain amount of flexibility has been built in to the formal definition of this class."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .
