<http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro#AggregatedAnnotation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An annotation aggregated within an ro:ResearchObject.  \n\nInstances of this class are used to annotated resources aggregated within the aggregating research object, proxies of these resources, or the research object itself. In other words, if :ro is the ro:ResearchObject this annotation has been ore:isAggregatedBy, then the annotation should have at least one ao:annotatesResource which is an ore:AggregatedResource which is ore:isAggregatedBy :ro, or the annotated resource is an ore:Proxy which ore:proxyIn :ro, or the annotated resource is :ro.\n\nIt is possible for the annotation to also annotate non-aggregated resources, but as above, at least one of them needs to be part of the RO or the RO itself.\n\nAs a subclass of ro:SemanticAnnotation the ao:body must point to an rdfg:Graph which contains the actual annotation.
