Examples of such services may include calendar, addressbook and mailbox managed by a PIM application. This category is introduced to distinguish between data available directly from the applications (Via some Interprocess Communication Mechanisms) and data available from files on a disk. In either case both DataObjects would receive a similar interpretation (e.g. a Mailbox) and wouldn't differ on the content level." <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/03/22/nfo> .
