Furter specializations of the saref:Energy class can be found in the SAREF4ENER extension, where classes such as EnergyMax, EnergyMin and EnergyExpected are defined.

It is also linked to the unit of measure in which the value is expressed and the timestamp of the measurement. The saref4imna:Measurement can be linked to individual Batches or Items. Moreover, the Measurement can be an ExpectedMeasurement (i.e. the value which is planned) or the ActualMeasurement (i.e. the value measured during production), which enables to check for deviations between the planned and actual values." <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4inma/> .
