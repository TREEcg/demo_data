E.g.,\nFunctionalSubstance(s) are included here as well.\nImmaterial (non-physical) artifacts (e.g. texts, ideas, cultural movements, corporations, communities, etc. can be modelled as social objects (see SocialObject), which are all 'artifactual' in the weak sense assumed here." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .
