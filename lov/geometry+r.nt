In case the geometry description is text-based or in a binary file format, it can be directly added to this property, if it is a file-based geometry description, the URI linking to the file should be added to this property. Should multiple geometries be added to the object, the omg:Geometry class with its relation (omg:hasGeometry) or even geometry states (omg:GeometryState and omg:hasGeometryState) should be introduced for each geometry resp. geometry version."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
