<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Unit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Unit Units are the segmentation of drama. A drama can have multiple\n            segmentations. Units are ordered by some Timeline. Units are devoted to the\n            representation of characters' actions. So, we require that any unit contains at\n            least one action whose description (ProcessSchema) encompasses at least one role having\n            an agent as a filler. If a building collapses, this action, by itself, can be part of\n            Unit only if an agent is involved in it (e.g., an agent dies). This definition\n            guarantees that, in the minimal case, at least one agent appears as filler of the roles\n            in the description of at least an action of every unit. A Unit has one or more actions\n            as its members (hasMember property)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#ConsistentStateSet> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A ConsistentStateSet is a set of states held consistent by definition. It can\n            be a set of states bordering a timeline (i.e., the state of affairs holding before and\n            after the timeline) or it can be the state of affairs that holds before and after a plan\n            (in this case, it represents the plan precondintions and effects). The\n            isTimelinePreconditionOf (isTimelineEffectOf) property connects a ConsistentStateSet\n            with a Timeline. The isPlanPreconditionOf (isPlanEffectOf) property connects a\n            ConsistentStateSet with a Plan. A ConsistentStateSet has one or more states as its\n            members (hasMember property)" <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
