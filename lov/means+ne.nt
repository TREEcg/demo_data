Net primary productivity is the excess of gross primary productivity of organic carbon (the rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (\"producers\"), for example,  photosynthesis in phytoplankton, over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. \"Nitrate utilization\" means net primary production by phytoplankton based on nitrate alone. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a  single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity  named by omitting the phrase.  The chemical formula for the nitrate anion is NO3-." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .
