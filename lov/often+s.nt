The preferred domain of this property is #Performance, so as to model that \"a concert presents a performance (of a musical work) that is realized by this performer\". However, in natural language, we often say that \"a concert has performers who play these musical works\", i.e. the domain of 'performer' is #Musical_Event in this case, and it would be more intuitive model. Hence, the domain is leave unrestricted here for a moment. " <http://www.kanzaki.com/ns/music> .

<http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop#hasDate> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Typically, Date will be associated with the creation or availability of the resource. Recommended best practice for encoding the date value is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 [W3CDTF] and includes (among others) dates of the form YYYY-MM-DD. For official documents, it could be the date of signature. It can also contain a java timestamp. Usually, time is connected to a happening (event/situation) in which the information resource is a participation entity. These include: creation of the information resource, its modification or other important happening. Very often such happening is in the background knowledge and the modeling of domain task does not require the explicit representation of this happening. If it plays important role in the model domain or for the task, then the user needs to extend the ontology in an appropriate way."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .
