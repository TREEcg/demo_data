<http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo#RandomForest> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set."@en <http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo> .

It allows for a better understanding of *why* something might have taken place, have been used or produced than the more generic [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), on which it is mainly based, does.  \n\n                                  The specialised decision modelling elements of this ontology have been derived from the [W3C Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/)'s Decision Ontology (DO) which can be found at <https://github.com/nicholascar/decision-o>. Many DO classes have been aligned with the PROV-O since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.\n\n                                  Unlike the original DO, this ontology cannot be used for *normative* scenarios: it is only capable of recording decisions that have already been made (so-called *data-driven* use in the DO). This is because PROV does not have a templating system which can indicate what *should* occur in future scenarios.\n\n                                  This ontology introduces only one new element for decision modelling over that which was present in the DO: an Agent which allows agency in decision making to be recorded."@en <http://promsns.org/def/decprov> .
