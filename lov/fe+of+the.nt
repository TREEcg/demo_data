Specifically, what is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness (closed-world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes. Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured in BioPAX using this class. \n \nUsage: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANT slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If all participants are known with exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead.\n\nExample: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid experiment where there is not enough experimental evidence to suggest that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#EntityFeature> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Description: A characteristic of a physical entity that can change while the entity still retains its biological identity. \n\nRationale: Two phosphorylated forms of a protein are strictly speaking different chemical  molecules. It is, however, standard in biology to treat them as different states of the same entity, where the entity is loosely defined based on sequence. Entity Feature class and its subclassses captures these variable characteristics. A Physical Entity in BioPAX represents a pool of  molecules rather than an individual molecule. This is a notion imported from chemistry( See PhysicalEntity). Pools are defined by a set of Entity Features in the sense that a single molecule must have all of the features in the set in order to be considered a member of the pool. Since it is impossible to list and experimentally test all potential features for an  entity, features that are not listed in the selection criteria is neglected Pools can also be defined by the converse by specifying features  that are known to NOT exist in a specific context. As DNA, RNA and Proteins can be hierarchically organized into families based on sequence homology so can entity features. The memberFeature property allows capturing such hierarchical classifications among entity features.\n\n\nUsage: Subclasses of entity feature describe most common biological instances and should be preferred whenever possible. One common usecase for instantiating  entity feature is, for describing active/inactive states of proteins where more specific feature information is not available.  \n\nExamples: Open/close conformational state of channel proteins, \"active\"/\"inactive\" states, excited states of photoreactive groups." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

This allows you to describe the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26 Feature IsA E53 Place) may be a practical approach.\n\nFor instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.\n\nThis property is a subproperty of P161 has spatial projection because it refers to its own domain as reference space for its range, whereas P161 has spatial projection may refer to a place in terms of any reference space. For some instances of E18 Physical Object the relative stability of form may not be sufficient to define a useful local reference space, for instance for an amoeba. In such cases the fully\ndeveloped path to an external reference space and using a temporal validity component may be adequate to determine the place they have occupied.\n\nIn contrast to P156 occupies, the property P53 has former or current location identifies an instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span. Further it does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of P53 Place.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP156 (x,y) = [E18(x) ∧ E53(y) ∧ P161(x,y) ∧ P157(y,x)]" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.\n\nThis classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually less time-dependent than the property value." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/sam-lite> .
