<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E4_Period> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\n\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nAs the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\n\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\n\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.\n\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\nJurassic\nEuropean Bronze Age\nItalian Renaissance\nThirty Years War\nSturm und Drang\nCubism\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE4(x) ⊃ E2(x)\nE4(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Role> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Role provides the pattern for the role fillers in a frame instantiation, that\n            occurs in SituationSchema, for describing processes and states. A Role is filled by a\n            DramaEntity: the fact that a given role has an entity as a filler is represented by the\n            hasFiller property and its inverse isFillerOf property. A Role belongs (isRoleOf) to a\n            given SituationSchema, namely a ProcessSchema or a StateSchema (hasRole property). The\n            Role class is related to its filler by the hasFiller property, whose range is the\n            DramaEntity class. For example, given the incident describable as \"Ophelia gives\n            the gift back to Hamlet\", the roles of \"donor\" (the one who does the\n            action of giving), \"recipient\" (the one wjho receives the object to be given)\n            and \"theme\" (the object of giving action) are all instance of the Role class\n            connected to the same Situation, each labeled with a linguistic label\n            (\"donor\", \"recipient\", etc.) and each connected to its filler via\n            the hasFiller property. Roles can also be intended as thematic roles of verbs following\n            the description contained in the Verbnet resource\n            (http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/index.php). The Role class, via the hasExtRef\n            object property, is linked to the subclass of the top level ExternalReference class, the\n            ExternalRefRole class, whose function is to connect the description of the role with the\n            appropriate role name or URI in a linguistic account of roles through apposite data\n            properties (namely, the Role_framenetRoleID and Role_verbnetRoleType data properties\n            respectively for FrameNet and VerbNet)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
