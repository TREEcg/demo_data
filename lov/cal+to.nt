<http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo#NaiveBayes> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.\n\nNaive Bayes has been studied extensively since the 1950s. It was introduced under a different name into the text retrieval community in the early 1960s:488 and remains a popular (baseline) method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features. With appropriate preprocessing, it is competitive in this domain with more advanced methods including support vector machines.It also finds application in automatic medical diagnosis.\n\nNaive Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.\n\nIn the statistics and computer science literature, Naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes.[4] All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method Russell and Norvig note that \"[naive Bayes] is sometimes called a Bayesian classifier, a somewhat careless usage that has prompted true Bayesians to call it the idiot Bayes model."@en <http://mex.aksw.org/mex-algo> .

<http://caressesrobot.org/ontology> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:\n\n- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?\n- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? \n- Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?\n- Topics of conversation.  Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?\n\nThe CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:\n\n- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner\n- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.\n- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted personâ€™s preferences and needs.\n\nPlease refer to the following for additional information:\n- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;\n- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.
