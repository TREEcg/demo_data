<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PluralNumber> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "PluralNumber is a number property that quantifies the denotation of the nominal element so that: 1) it specifies that there are more than one. In this English example below, plural is shown by both the noun and the verb in (2): \n\n(1) my dog watches television \n(2) my dogs watch television \n\n[Corbett 2000: 5] \n\n2) additionally, but not necessarily, pluralNumber may be assigned on the basis of formal properties (e.g. pluralia tantum, or measles / *measle). 3) if pluralNumber functions as generalNumber, it may specify a lack of commitment with regard to quantification ([Corbett 2000: 17] notes this system does not exist in pure form, that is, no language employs it as the normal case).\n\nSome Cushitic languages, generalNumber can be the same as singularNumber for some nouns, but the same as pluralNumber for other nouns. For example, in Arbore (arv), generalNumber may contrast with the singular in the absence of a distinct plural form: Ln Singular Ln tiis-in 'a maize cob' Ln lasa-n 'a loaf' \n\nnebel-in 'a cock ostrich' ln General ln tíise 'maize cob(s)' ln lássa 'bread' ln nebel 'ostrich(es)' ln [Corbett 2000: 17-18]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
