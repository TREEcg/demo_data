The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered \"new\" if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered \"new\" because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.\n\nThis entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.\n\nAn event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n\nExamples:\n- the construction of the SS Great Britain\n- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen\n- Rembrandt's creating of the seventh state of his etching \"Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove\", 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12,E65,E81)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE12(x) ⊃ E11(x)\nE12(x) ⊃ E63(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<https://w3id.org/pep/ProcessExecutor> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Process Executor can execute (implement) processes. A Process Executor may be a physical device, a computational method, a web service, a laboratory setup with a person following a method, or any other thing that can follow a Process. This concept generalizes ssn:Sensor, which in the latest version of the SSN ontology is a subclass of dul:Object. A dul:Object is any physical, social, or mental object, or a substance.\n\nPrototypical process executors are Sensor, Actuator, Estimator.\n\nLinks to ProcessExecution describe the Executions made.\n\nLinks to Processes define how the executor can make Executions (it may implement several Processes). A Process Executor implements each of the methods used by the Executions it made. \n\nOther metadata may detail geolocation, vendor, operator, consumed power, etc."@en <https://w3id.org/pep/> .
