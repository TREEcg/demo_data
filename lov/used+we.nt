Every web page is implicitly assumed to be declared to be of type WebPage, so the various properties about that webpage, such as <code>breadcrumb</code> may be used. We recommend explicit declaration if these properties are specified, but if they are found outside of an itemscope, they will be assumed to be about the page." <http://schema.org/> .
