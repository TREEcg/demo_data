<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/RomanNumeralGender> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A convention for labeling gender values. Roman numerals are often used for languages for which there is a descriptive tradition involving use of the term 'noun class' instead of 'gender', in particular in languages of the Caucasus or Bantu languages, and are particularly useful where the number of genders is large.If the 'noun classes' are involved in agreement systems, they are gender systems. Roman numerals may also be used in instances where another label is possible. In one language the gender to which nouns with male rational denotation are assigned might be called 'masculine', whereas in another language nouns with a similar denotation may be assigned to a gender with an arbitrary Roman numerical label such as 'I'.
