Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes. \n\nSpecific subclasses of E41 Appellation should be used when instances of E41 Appellation of a characteristic form are used for particular objects. Instances of E49 Time Appellation, for example, which take the form of instances of E50 Date, can be easily recognised.\n\nE41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment \n\nExamples:\n- \"Martin\" \n- \"the Forth Bridge\"\n- \"the Merchant of Venice\" (E35)\n- \"Spigelia marilandica (L.) L.\" [not the species, just the name]\n- \"information science\" [not the science itself, but the name through which we refer to it in an English-speaking context] \n- “安” [Chinese \"an\", meaning \"peace\"]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE41(x) ⊃ E90(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E52_Time-Span> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end and a duration.\n\nTime Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation.\n\nSince our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely.  An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known.\n\nAutomatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.\n\nExamples:\n- 1961\n- from 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996\n- 14h30 - 16h22 4th July 1945\n- 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999\n- duration of the Ming Dynasty\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE52(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
