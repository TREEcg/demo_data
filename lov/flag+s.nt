<http://spinrdf.org/spin#thisUnbound> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Can be set to true for SPIN rules and constraints that do not require pre-binding the variable ?this with all members of the associated class. This flag should only be set to true if the WHERE clause is sufficiently strong to only bind instances of the associated class, or its subclasses. In those cases, the engine can greatly improve performance of query execution, because it does not need to add clauses to narrow down the WHERE clause." <http://spinrdf.org/spin> .
