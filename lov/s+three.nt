This step involves five Tasks. The tasks Walking, CountingBackwards and WalkingAndCountingBackwards are used for characterizing participantsâ€™ gait in mono and dual tasks, and the impact of cognitive activity on gait (e.g., walking speed, step length, stops during the walking exercise done in dual task). The tasks SentenceRepeating and ArticulationControl are vocally-directed tasks: one task consists of repeating a sentence after the clinician (this task is repeated with three sentences), and the other is an articulation control exercise done to evaluate the neuromuscular mechanism of speech production."@en <http://www.demcare.eu/ontologies/demlab.owl> .

Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.\n\nThis classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually less time-dependent than the property value." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/sam-lite> .
