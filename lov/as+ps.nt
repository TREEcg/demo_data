Systematic reviews of high-quality randomized controlled trials are crucial to evidence-based medicine. An understanding of systematic reviews and how to implement them in practice is becoming mandatory for all professionals involved in the delivery of health care. Systematic reviews are not limited to medicine,  and are quite common in other sciences such as psychology, educational research and sociology."@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
