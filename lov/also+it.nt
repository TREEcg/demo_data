That is, not a quality of an abstract entity as is also allowed by DUL's Quality, but rather an aspect of an entity that is intrinsic to and cannot exist without the entity and is observable by a sensor, or operable by an actuator. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a property may also itself be a feature of interest. For example if a fridge uses alternative current energy, then several aspects of its energy consumption property may be quantified. Examples of such aspects include:\r\n\r\n- the active power consumption;\r\n- the reactive power consumption;\r\n- the phase of voltage relative to current;\r\n- the frequency;\r\n- the minimal operating value of the frequency;\r\n- the number of occurences of unusual values.\r\n\r\nThese are different properties of the same property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nex:activePower a owl:ObjectProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:subPropertyOf seas:hasProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:domain seas:PowerProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:range seas:PowerProperty .\r\n\r\n<fridge/1/consumption> a seas:FeatureOfInterest ;\r\n  ex:activePower <fridge/1/consumption/activePower> .\r\n```\r\n\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology> .
