<https://w3id.org/seas/Service> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "In economics, a service is an economic activity where an immaterial exchange of value occurs. When a service such as labor is performed the buyer does not take exclusive ownership of that which is purchased, unless agreed upon by buyer and seller. The benefits of such a service, if priced, are held to be self-evident in the buyer's willingness to pay for it (source: Wikipedia).\r\n    "@en <https://w3id.org/seas/TradingOntology> .
