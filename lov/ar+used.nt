<http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property#atmosphere_mass_content_of_aromatic_compounds> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> " \"Content\" indicates a quantity per unit area.  The \"atmosphere content\" of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including content_of_atmosphere_layer are used.  Aromatic compounds in organic chemistry are compounds that contain at least one benzene ring of six carbon atoms joined by alternating single and double covalent bonds.  The simplest aromatic compound is benzene itself.  In standard names \"aromatic_compounds\" is the term used to describe the group of aromatic chemical species that  are represented within a given model.  The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute.  Standard names exist for some individual aromatic species, e.g. benzene and xylene." <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnx/cf/cf-property> .

It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc. In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.\nA digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of the manuscript page\nIt is an implicit transitive property.\n\nExamples:\t\n\n- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) P165 incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E38) P165 incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E38) P165 incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E73(x)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E90(y)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ P106(x,y)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

This means that the first property will always have the same value as the second. Cases where this relation can be used are if an object's geometry is modelled RDF-based and contains a property defining e.g. the height of the object. Then the non-geometric property for height should be explicitly derived from the geometric property to ensure data integrity."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
