<http://purl.org/openorg/twitterHashtag> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This is used to relate a concept to the Twitter hashtag people are using to talk about that thing.\n\nWe've created the twitterHashtag in the open org namespace. A hashtag can be related to a concept, location, event, or anything. A combination of hashtags may be used in one literal to indicate that it is that combination of hashtags which is associated with that resource.\n\nHaving two oo:twitterHashtag properties, however, would indicate that either is used to refer to the same thing (not recommended).\n\n<oo:twitterHashtag>#myconf2010<oo:twitterHashtag>\n\nor, to indicate a combo hashtag:\n\n<oo:twitterHashtag>#myconf2010 #track2<oo:twitterHashtag>\n\nInstead of a string literal this may also point to a URI used to identify the hashtag." <http://purl.org/openorg/> .

Note the difference with Datasets, which hold metadata about many things. Thing graphs are usually exposed to user friendly tools which allow users with little on no RDF skills to specifically edit a metadata about a thing in a form. For example a thing graph can contain metadata about a football team such as its various names, LOD links for the team, a short disambiguation hint, e.t.c. Thing graphs are also used to store metadata about things obtained from a feed, for example store metadata about locations obtained from a Location Services feed."@en-gb <http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance> .
