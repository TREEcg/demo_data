Topic salience is available for assignment to various arguments, including the patient, but Focus salience is always assigned to agent, and is therefore inaccessible to the patient or any other nominal. [Klaiman 1991: 236] Dayley describes the focus antipassive as a rearranging voice whose primary function is to indicate that the agent of a transitive sentence is highlighted or in focus. The focus antipassive is used when the agent is in contrastive focus or highly emphatic, when the agent is questioned, and when the agent is relativized.

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/AbsolutiveAntipassiveVoice> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A term used by some Mayanists to refer to an antipassive in which the patient or logical object is supressed or overtly absent. [Klaiman 1991: 232] Dayley states that the absolutive antipassive is used when the patient is unknown or irrelevant, or when the speaker does not wish to mention the patient, or to describe a transitive activity typically performed by some agent. The absolutive antipassive requires a non-specific implied patient, and no specific patient is ever semantically recoverable from the speech context. Only the absolutive antipassive has (as the name implies) absolutive function such that a transitive activity may be discussed without mention of the patient. [Dayley 1985: 345-350] This type of antipassive with an obligatorily unidentified object is also found in Mam, another Mayan language. [Cooreman 1994: 52-53]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
