<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DescriptionTemplate> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DescriptionTemplate This class contains a well known role-based pattern for\n            representing the linguistic schemata that describe the elements of drama, such as the\n            entities and dynamics. Drammar imports this pattern from other ontologies, namely DOLCE.\n            The class DescriptionTemplate contains two classes: - Role - SituationSchema The class\n            SituationSchema provides the specific pattern for the description of incidents and\n            states, generically termed here as \"situations\". A situation can be either a\n            process or a state, usually described by a linguistic expression consisting of a verb\n            (\"giving\") for processes, such as in the expression \"Ophelia gives the\n            gift back to Hamlet\", or a by a preposition (\"behind\") for states, such\n            as in the expression \"Polonius is behind the tapestry\"). The Role class\n            provides the pattern for the roles that play a part in the state or process (in the\n            above example, the role of the \"donor\" filled by Ophelia, the role of the\n            \"recipient\" filled by Hamlet, etc.). The linguistic counterpart of the\n            role-based structure of the description templates is provided by a frame-like accounts\n            of the linguistic descriptions of events, such as Framenet or Verbnet\n            (https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml). Based on a lexical\n            semantics perspective, these initiatives are aimed at grouping verbs (including\n            statives) into \"frames of action\", i.e., linguistic structures representing a\n            group of semantically similar verbs with the complements that accompany them. Following\n            a design choice that characterizes the Drammar ontology, all references to the external\n            (linguistic or commonsense) knowledge are mediated by the ExternalReference class, a top\n            level class whose function is specifically to act as a bridge to the external knowledge\n            (see the documentation of the class). So, neither the Roles nor the Situation Schemata\n            directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge they assume: rather, the hasExtRef\n            property links each component of the pattern onto its corresponding class within the\n            ExternalReference class: the SituationSchema class is related to the ExternalRefSchema,\n            the Role class is related to the ExternalRefRole class. Each ExternalReference subclass,\n            then, bridges each pattern component onto the corresponding component within the\n            external knowledge source via a specific data type property." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
