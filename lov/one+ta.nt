This step involves five Tasks. The tasks Walking, CountingBackwards and WalkingAndCountingBackwards are used for characterizing participantsâ€™ gait in mono and dual tasks, and the impact of cognitive activity on gait (e.g., walking speed, step length, stops during the walking exercise done in dual task). The tasks SentenceRepeating and ArticulationControl are vocally-directed tasks: one task consists of repeating a sentence after the clinician (this task is repeated with three sentences), and the other is an articulation control exercise done to evaluate the neuromuscular mechanism of speech production."@en <http://www.demcare.eu/ontologies/demlab.owl> .

CDC predefines three instances of this class, i.e. cdc:incoming, cdc:internal and cdc:outgoing. Each catalog, dataset, distribution or data service can only have one tag that is not supposed to change over the lifetime of the described resource unless it considers a dataset (that is not a catalog). When necessary, qualified relations between DCAT entities can also get a tag."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .
