<http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance/ThingGraph> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Thing graphs hold metadata about a single thing. Note the difference with Datasets, which hold metadata about many things. Thing graphs are usually exposed to user friendly tools which allow users with little on no RDF skills to specifically edit a metadata about a thing in a form. For example a thing graph can contain metadata about a football team such as its various names, LOD links for the team, a short disambiguation hint, e.t.c. Thing graphs are also used to store metadata about things obtained from a feed, for example store metadata about locations obtained from a Location Services feed."@en-gb <http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/provenance> .

Typically, service providers (e.g. banks or ISPs) provide accounts to their customers or users, which are considered account owners. The existence of the account depends on the provider, even though the user owns it in some metaphoric sense. Examples could be bank, ISP, e-Commerce, ICQ, email accounts. The accounts are usually aligned with a sort of contract."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protonext> .
