In the case of natural languages, their components are 'temporary' and 'reconstructed' out of actual usage. For example, a grammar for a natural language has the status of a theory for that language, and alternative ones can exist (e.g. generative vs. construction grammars).\nAnother distinction, between the general (systemic) rules for a language, and the local (contextual) rules for e.g. a certain context, speaker, place, etc., can be made separately.\nThe most comprehensive classification of languages ha probably been made by Umberto Eco, based on the production modes of the 'signs' that are represented in a certain language. It uses several semiotic dimensions, and will be modeled in a forthcoming ontology." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl> .

On the contrary, a CoText is actually a neighborhood of a certain chunk of text, which can be built based on a syntagmatic rule (all words from the sentence where the chunk occurs), an associative rule (all terms that are related to the chunk across the texts of a corpus, given a certain statistical threshold), etc.\nContexts can also emerge based on what relations are considered \"context triggers\". For example, in this ontology very different relations: part, participation, setting, membership, acting for, localization, etc. are considered context triggers by adding owl:subPropertyOf axioms to the property: isContextOf. Since the class Context has an equivalent axiom to isContextOf someValuesFrom dul:Entity, everything has a property that is declared subPropertyOf isContextOf, will be inferred to be a Context as well." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> .
