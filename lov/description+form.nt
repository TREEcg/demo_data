<https://w3id.org/omg#hasComplexGeometryDescription> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Relation between an object, a geometry, or a geometry state and its RDF-based geometry description. If more than one geometry description should be added to an object, the relation omg:hasGeometry to a new individual of the type omg:Geometry should be used for each geometry description. This step is necessary to allow interconnections between the geometry descriptions regarding their derivation or complementation for easier upkeep of data integrity. The introduction of subproperties of this property for specific geometry descriptions (e.g. OntoBREP, GEOM, OntoSTEP) may ease querying for wanted geometry description formats."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .

This node can be used to attach additional information to the information as author, time of creation, geometry context or dependencies with other geometry descriptions as transformations, complementations or derivations. By creating subclasses of this class for specific types of geometry descriptions (e.g. OBJ, GEOM, glTF), more informational value can be added and used in querying for specific geometry description formats."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
