<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#Complex> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A physical entity whose structure is comprised of other physical entities bound to each other covalently or non-covalently, at least one of which is a macromolecule (e.g. protein, DNA, or RNA) and the Stoichiometry of the components are known. \n\nComment: Complexes must be stable enough to function as a biological unit; in general, the temporary association of an enzyme with its substrate(s) should not be considered or represented as a complex. A complex is the physical product of an interaction (complexAssembly) and is not itself considered an interaction.\nThe boundaries on the size of complexes described by this class are not defined here, although possible, elements of the cell  such a mitochondria would typically not be described using this class (later versions of this ontology may include a cellularComponent class to represent these). The strength of binding cannot be described currently, but may be included in future versions of the ontology, depending on community need.\nExamples: Ribosome, RNA polymerase II. Other examples of this class include complexes of multiple protein monomers and complexes of proteins and small molecules." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#CovalentBindingFeature> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition : An entity feature that represent the covalently bound state of  a physical entity. \n\nRationale: Most frequent covalent modifications to proteins and DNA, such as phosphorylation and metylation are covered by the ModificationFeature class. In these cases, the added groups are simple and stateless therefore they can be captured by a controlled vocabulary. In other cases, such as ThiS-Thilacyl-disulfide, the covalently linked molecules are best represented as a molecular complex. CovalentBindingFeature should be used to model such covalently linked complexes.\n\nUsage: Using this construct, it is possible to represent small molecules as a covalent complex of two other small molecules. The demarcation of small molecules is a general problem and is delegated to small molecule databases.The best practice is not to model using covalent complexes unless at least one of the participants is a protein, DNA or RNA.\n\nExamples:\ndisulfide bond\nUhpC + glc-6P -> Uhpc-glc-6p\nacetyl-ACP -> decenoyl-ACP\ncharged tRNA" <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
