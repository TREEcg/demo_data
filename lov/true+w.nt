<http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/MarineTLO/v4/marinetlo.owl#BC45_Observation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This class comprises the activity of gaining scientific knowledge about particular states of physical reality gained by empirical evidence, experiments and by measurements. We define observation in the sense of natural sciences, as a kind of human activity: at some Place and within some Time-Span, certain Physical Things and their behavior and interactions are observed, either directly by human sensory impression, or enhanced with tools and measurement devices. The output of the internal processes of measurement devices that do not require additional human interaction are in general regarded as part of the observation and not as additional inference. Manual recordings may serve as additional evidence. Measurements and witnessing of events are special cases of observations. Observations result in a belief about certain propositions. In this model, the degree of confidence in the observed properties is regarded to be “true” per default, but could be described differently by adding a property LC7 is about  to an instance of BC45  Observation, or by reification of the property O16 observed value. Primary data from measurement devices are regarded in this model to be results of observation and can be interpreted as propositions believed to be true within the (known) tolerances and degree of reliability of the device. Observations represent the transition between reality and propositions in the form of instances of a formal ontology, and can be subject to data evaluation from this point on."@en <http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/MarineTLO/v4/marinetlo.owl> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Goal> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Goal class represents the objectives of an agent. In the BDI model, the\n            agent is driven by her desires, or goal, and forms plans to achieve them. In Drammar, a\n            goal is achieved by a plan; the achives object property connects a plan with the goal it\n            achieves (a single goal, since the achieves property is functional). An agent intends\n            (intends object property) a goal. Formally, the Goal class is a defined as a subclass of\n            the MentalState class which is constrained: - to be the goal of some agent - to be part\n            of some ConsistentStateState - to be described by a GoalSchema Goal has a propositional\n            content that is - a process in the case of perform goal PG (Hamlet wants to ask Ophelia\n            ...) - a state in the case of - achievement (Hamlet wants Ophelia goes to a nunnery) -\n            maintenance (Hamlet wants Claudius (keeps) believing Hamlet is mad) - query (Hamlet\n            wants to know whether Ophelia is honest) In these various cases the propositional\n            content is different: - Perform Goal - PC: Action - AG - PC: State, embedded in one\n            Belief, with status false or Process, embedded in Belief, with accomplishment false - MG\n            - PC: State or Process, embedded in Belief, with status/accomplishment true - Query Goal\n            - PC: depends on query; e.g.: - Y/N question: the boolean status of a state (currently\n            implemented as a State with status TRUE) - Wh question: the filler of a role in some\n            state or process (currently not implemented) These are guidelines for writing the plans\n            correctly." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
