The minimal components of a nanopublication are as follows:\n* the factual assertion itself, in the form subject, predicate and object (e.g. malaria is_a disease);\n* provenance information about the nanopublication, defining its authorship and creation date;\n* supporting information (optional), providing context for the assertion;\n* a unique identifier for the nanopublication, in the form of a URI;\n* an integrity key that ensures that the nanopublication is in its original form and has not been altered.\n"@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
