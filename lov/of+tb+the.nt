<http://www.essepuntato.it/2013/10/vagueness> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "Vagueness is a common human knowledge and language phenomenon, typically manifested by terms and concepts like High, Expert, Bad, Near etc.\n\nIn an OWL ontology vagueness may appear in the definitions of classes, properties, datatypes and individuals. For these entities a more explicit description of the nature and characteristics of their vagueness/non-vagueness is required.\n\nAnalyzing and describing the nature of vagueness/non-vagueness in ontological entities is subjective activity, since it is often a personal interpretation of someone (a person or, more generally, an agent).\n\nVagueness can be described according to at least two complementary types referring to quantitative or qualitative connotations respectively. The quantitative aspect of vagueness concerns the (real or apparent) lack of precise boundaries defining an entity along one or more specific dimensions. The qualitative aspect of vagueness concerns the identification of such other discriminants of which boundaries are not quantifiable in any precise way.\n\nEither a vagueness description, that specifies always a type, or a non-vagueness description provides at least a justification (defined either as natural language text, an entity or a more complex logic formula, or any combination of them) that motivates a specific aspect of why an entity should be intended as vague/non-vague. Multiple justifications are possible for the same description.\n\nThe justification of a description of vagueness having quantitative type can include an explicit definition of the dimensions (defined either as natural language text, an entity or a more complex logic formula, or any combination of them) in which the entity is vague.\n\nA description of vagueness/non-vagueness can also be context-dependent. In particular, the context-dependent objects are:\n\n- the descriptions of vagueness/non-vagueness related to entities (i.e. the same entity can be vague in one context and non-vague in another);\n\n- the dimensions related to a description of vagueness having quantitative type (i.e. the same entity can be vague in dimension A in one context and in dimension B in another). Note that it is the relation between a justification and a certain dimension that may specify a particular context, rather than the dimension itself.\n\nThe annotation of an entity with information about its vagueness is a particular act of tagging done by someone (i.e., an agent) who associates a description of vagueness/non-vagueness (called the body of the annotation) to the entity in consideration (called the target of the annotation)."@en <http://www.essepuntato.it/2013/10/vagueness> .
