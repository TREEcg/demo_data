<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

For example, \"3.1.1\". The successive  levels of integers provide for a successive level of status code granularity.\n\nThe following are initial classes for the return status code. Individual iCalendar object methods will define specific return status codes for these classes. In addition, other classes for the return status code may be defined using the registration process defined later in this memo.\n\n 1.xx - Preliminary success. This class of status of status code indicates that the request has request has been initially processed but that completion is pending.\n\n2.xx -Successful. This class of status code indicates that the request was completed successfuly. However, the exact status code can indicate that a fallback has been taken.\n\n3.xx - Client Error. This class of status code indicates that the request was not successful. The error is the result of either a syntax or a semantic error in the client formatted request. Request should not be retried until the condition in the request is corrected.\n\n4.xx - Scheduling Error. This class of status code indicates that the request was not successful.

(Note: Not all dataflow systems have this concept of workflow parameters)\n\nwfdesc:Parameter descriptions are linked using wfdesc:DataLink descriptions associated with the wfdesc:Workflow using wfdesc:hasDataLink.\n\nA wfdesc:Parameter defined with wfdesc:hasInput on a wfdesc:Workflow is considered an wfdesc:Input \"outside\" the workflow (ie. if it is a subworkflow), but an wfdesc:Output \"inside\" the workflow (where it can be connected to a wfdesc:Input of a wfdesc:Process). Thus such parameters can be linked \"through\" the workflow without having a \"mirrored\" port inside.\n\n\nExample:\n\n```\n@prefix wfdesc: <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#> .\n:outerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow :innerWorkflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubProcess :procA, :procC .\n\n:procA a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param1 .\n\n:procC a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param2 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param3 .\n\n\n:innerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param4 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param5 ;\n  wfdesc:hasProcess :procB .\n\n:procB a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param6 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param7 .\n\n:innerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param4; wfdesc:hasSink :param6 ],\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param7; wfdesc:hasSink :param5 ] .\n\n:outerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param1; wfdesc:hasSink :param4 ],\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param5; wfdesc:hasSink :param2 ] .\n```\n\n\nIn this example :param1 is the output of :procA. :param1 is the source in a datalink that goes to the input :param4 of the :innerWorkflow. :param4 is however also the source of an inner datalink, going to input :param6 of the nested :procB.\n\nFrom this :param4 is both an wfdesc:Input and wfdesc:Output (which is why these two classes are not disjoint)"@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#SituationSchema> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The situation schema provides the pattern for the description of incidents and states. It is inspired by the Situation ontology Pattern of the Ontology Design Pattern initiative (http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/). So, a SituationSchema describes (\"describes\" object property) a DramaPerdurant (either a State or a Process).\nThe schema works as a hub for the roles involved in a situation. The property hasRole links the Situation class (its domain) with the Role class (the range of the property). Also, notice that, as illustrated in the documentation of the SituationSchema class, a Situation Schema (or, better, its subclasses) does not directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge employed to describe drama: rather, it refers to the ExternalRefSchema class (subclass of the top level ExternalReference class), which in  turn refers to the linguistic knowledge. The SituationSchema class specializes into specific schemata for describing specific type of situations: \n- FrameNetSchema: for describing processes, like giving or killing (in Drammar, they are grouped into units arranged on timelines), and states, like being behind some object or being dead (in Drammar, they are bundled into sets that border timelines and plans). \n- MentalStateSchema: this class groups the specific types of schemata for describing the mental states of the agents in Drammar, namely beliefs, goals, emotions and values. \nTechnically, the subtypes of SituationSchema are characterized by different values of the quale_schemaType data property: \"belief\", \"emotion\", \"framenet\", \"goal\",  \"value\". \nFinally, it is worth mentioning that is a specific design choice of Drammar not to represent the nesting of states: only the type of the top level state, e.g., a belief, is represented, independent of what that belief contains in turn. This flat style of representation is determined by the decision not to commit to a specific logical account of state types. When Drammar is employed for annotation, the content nested into a state is described informally in natural language description accompanying the state, if needed. \nRefs: Gangemi, A., & Presutti, V.

The DramaEdurant is the class of elements of Drama that describe the\n            story dynamics, i.e. Processes and States. In the context of Drammar, the individuals of\n            this class describe the story advancement in terms of incidents and states holding\n            between incidents. Each has a specific relation to the segmentation of drama: processes\n            are grouped in units, states precedes and follows timelines (which contain units).\n            Notice that processes and states are not distinct in Framenet, the knowledge source we\n            refer to for describing perdurants outside of Drammar.

It can be contrasted with a mathematical constant, which is a fixed numerical value but does not directly involve any physical measurement. There are many physical constants in science, some of the most widely recognized being the speed of light in vacuum c, Newton's gravitational constant G, Planck's constant h, the electric permittivity of free space Îµ0, and the elementary charge e. Physical constants can take many dimensional forms, or may be dimensionless depending on the system of quantities and units used."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
