However, it is possible to stick to FRBR and bypass the worflow\nmechanism this ontology defines by using the core FRBR properties on such objects. But it is often better to use events to interconnect such \nexpressions (allowing to go deeply into the production process - `this performer was playing this particular instrument at that\nparticular time').\n    \n    " <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .

We recognize the work through individual realizations or expressions of the work, but the work itself exists only in the commonality of\ncontent between and among the various expressions of the work. When we speak of Homer's Iliad as a work, our point of reference is not a particular recitation or text of the work, but the intellectual creation that lies behind all the various expressions of the work.     \n\nFor example:\n\nwork #1 J.
