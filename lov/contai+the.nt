The relation between trees and tree nodes is represented by the containsTN\n            abd hasRoot object properties. A drama is actually a tree, composed recursively of\n            subtrees, which are scenes at different levels. The subtree relationship is established\n            between scenes (property hasChild), which are actually tree nodes." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Plan> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Plan A plan is a sequence of actions devised by an agent to achieve some Goal.\n            In the BDI model, the agent's 'intention' to execute a plan is the bridge\n            between goals and practical actions. In Drammar, a plan is intended by (intendedBy\n            object property) an Agent to achieve (achieve property) some Goal. As a consequence, the\n            plan motivates (isMotivationFor object property) a timeline (i.e. a given extent of the\n            drama text). These are the necessary and sufficient conditions of class. Following the\n            paradigm of hierarchical planning, plans are recursive. So plans can contains actions or\n            other, simpler plans. Formally, a Plan is a list (namely, it is a subclass of the List\n            class) whose elements are simpler plans (for abstract plans) or actions (for directly\n            executable plans). A plan is related to its elements by the containsOLE\n            property." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://schema.org/CreativeWorkSeries> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/ItemList\">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as tv, radio and games).<br/><br/>\n\nSpecific subtypes are available for describing <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/TVSeries\">TVSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/RadioSeries\">RadioSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/MovieSeries\">MovieSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/BookSeries\">BookSeries</a>, <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/Periodical\">Periodical</a> and <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/VideoGameSeries\">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case, the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/hasPart\">hasPart</a> / <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/isPartOf\">isPartOf</a> properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.<br/><br/>\n\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate." <http://schema.org/> .
