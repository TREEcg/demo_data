The identity of an instance of this class is determined by the identities of the constituing spacetime volume and the time-span. \n\nThis class can be used to define temporal snapshots at a particular time-span, such as the extent of the Roman Empire at 33 B.C., or the extent occupied by a museum object at rest in an exhibit. In particular, it can be used to define the spatial projection of a spacetime volume during a particular time-span, such as the maximal spatial extent of a flood at some particular hour, or all areas covered by the Poland within the 20th century AD.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE93(x) âŠƒ E92(x)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
