If many modules are needed in a same ontology project, it is anyway useful to use this integrated version.\n\nThe final result is a lightweight, easy-to-apply foundational ontology for modeling either physical or social contexts.\nSeveral extensions of DOLCE+DnS Ultralite have been designed; see for example the extensions for information objects: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl, \nfor systems: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/SystemsLite.owl, \nfor plans: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/PlansLite.owl, \nfor the legal domain: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/CLO/CoreLegal.owl, \nand for the lexical and semiotic domains: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L2.owl; etc." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo> "In 3.2, the links between instances of Region or Parameter, and datatypes have been revised and made more powerful, in order to support efficient design patterns for data value modelling in OWL1.0.\nAlso, the names of the related properties have been changed in order to make them more intuitive.\nFurthermore, a large comment field has been added to the 'expresses' object property, in order to clarify some issues about the many interpretations.\nIn 3.3, the relation between regions, parameters, and datatypes has been still improved.\nIn 3.5, the person-related classes have been refactored: Person in 3.4 is now SocialPerson, to avoid confusion with commonsense intuition; Person is now the union of social persons and humans, therefore being a subclass of Agent.\nIn 3.6, other fixes on universal restriction involving expresses. Also added the property 'isConstraintFor' between parameters and entities. Moved the properties: 'assumes' and 'adopts' to the new module: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/Conceptualization.owl.\nIn 3.7, some fixes on the names of classes and properties related to FormalEntity; created a new separate module for general universal restrictions (DULGCI.owl).\nIn 3.8, more fixes on the interface to formal entities and links to IOLite.owl.\nIn 3.9, some naming and comment fixes.\nIn 3.10, removed cardinality restriction from hasPart and isPartOf restrictions (changed to hasComponent and isComponentOf), for OWL(DL) compatibility. Also enlarged the range of includesAgent to contain both social and physical agents, and of conceptualizes universal restriction on agents, to include all social objects.\nIn 3.11, some more subproperty axioms have been introduced, and all elements have got English labels.\nIn 3.12, added some classes to map some old DolceLitePlus classes that were used to align OntoWordNet.\nIn 3.13, added the LocalConcept class to express a Concept that cannot be used in a Description different from the one that defines it. Also updated some comments.\nIn 3.14, added some comments.\nIn 3.15, removed some owl:disjointWith axioms relating Collection to InformationObject, Description, Situation, and SocialAgent. The rationale for doing that is to allow less strict constraints on domain relations involving collections that can be also conceived as descriptions, situations, social agents, or information objects; for example: a collection of sentences from a text (an information object) that are ranked with a relevance criterion can be still considered a text.\nIn 3.16, name of isActedBy changed to actsThrough, which is clearer. Also added SpatioTemporalRegion as constituted by a SpaceRegion and a TimeInterval.\nIn 3.17, removed redundant universal axioms from Entity and other top classes. Fixed restrictions on FunctionalSubstance class, and comments in Design and Substance classes.\nIn 3.18, removed subClassOf axiom from FunctionalSubstance to DesignedArtifact, created a new subclass of FunctionalSubstance, called DesignedSubstance, and created a subClassOf axiom from DesignedSubstance to DesignedArtifact.\nIn 3.19, removed disjointness axiom between Concept and Collection (the same rationale applies as in 3.15 version.\nIn 3.20, revised the comment for Quality, added InformationEntity as the superclass for InformationObject and InformationRealization (represented as the union of those classes). This is needed in many domain ontologies that do not need to distinguish between abstract and concrete aspects of information entities. One possible revision (not implemented here) would be to introduce the relations: expresses and isAbout with a broader domain:InformationEntity, and two more specific properties: abstractlyExpresses and isAbstractlyAbout. This last revision has not been implemented yet, since a large revision procedure should be carried out in order to check the impact of the revision on the existing DOLCE-DnS-Ultralite plugins.\nIn 3.21, added comment to InformationEntity, and optimized representation of equivalence for InformationRealization.\nIn 3.22, added comment to Personification.\nIn 3.23, added associatedWith object property, and put all object properties as subproperties of it.\nIn 3.24, removed hasProxy datatype property.\nIn 3.25, generalized domain and range of hasComponent and isComponentOf.\nIn 3.26, updated some comments in order to clarify or exemplify the concepts.\nIn 3.27, added rdfs:isDefinedBy annotations for Linked Data browsers.\nIn 3.28, broadened the universe of pre-/post-conditions to give room to events and states.\nIn 3.29, added some properties to support DBpedia alignment: sameSettingAs (situational analogous to coparticipation), including relations originating e.g. from sharing kinship, ownership, or roleplaying situations.\nIn 3.30, completed some domains and ranges (formerly owl:Thing, now dul:Entity), and added axiom: Organism subClassOf PhysicalAgent.\nIn 3.31, added a restriction to Quality and one to Region in order to ensure the original DOLCE constraint of qualities being always associated with a region, and vice versa. These axioms do not however exclude a direct applicability of qualities or regions to any other entity." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .
