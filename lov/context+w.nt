<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PerfectTense> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A value of Tense Feature assigned to the designated element in the clause when the meaning selected for the clause is that intended to locate the event spoken about as anterior, simultaneous, or posterior to the deictic centre of the utterance, and additionally the reference point from which this event is viewed is separated and moved away from the event time. This alters the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. 'Perfect' temporal relations contrast with 'simple' temporal relations in which the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach 1947].\nThere are two types of 'perfect' context which may lead to separate tense values:\n(1) The first type occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and instead located after the event time. A common example occurs with an anterior temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time to the moment of speech. The event time is anterior to the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the event and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have read this book, I have seen John --- hence the interpretation that the event has an effect or is in some way still relevant at the moment of speech. [Note that in some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' anterior meaning and labelled simply as Past.] The interpretation of this type of the perfect often includes at least two related but distinguishable uses: the resultative perfect (Someone has stolen my purse) and the experiential perfect (I have read this book before) [Dahl and Velupillai 2005: 271].\n(2) The second type occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and instead located before the event time. A common example occurs with a simultaneous temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time and located before the moment of speech. The event time is still simultaneous with the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the reference point and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have lived here [for ten years] --- hence the interpretation that the event which began in the past extends up to the moment of speech. [Note that in some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' simultaneous meaning and labelled simply as Present.] The interpretation of this type of the perfect is often referred to as the universal perfect or perfect of persistent situation.\nTypically, for a tense value to be labelled as Perfect Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the meaning resulting from the separation of the reference point from the event time, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings.

While some personal pronouns in some languages occur in essentially the same sentence position as other nominal expressions, it is rather common for them to show distributional peculiarities.  Personal pronouns may be clitics whose distribution may be consistently distinct from that of non-clitic nominals.  It is also common for the equivalent of personal pronouns to be expressed by affixes on the verb. [Schachter 1985: 25-26]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

See more detail in the [EBG Semantic Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhMOTlIOC6dOK_jksJRX0CB-GIRoiYY6fWtCnZArUhU/edit) google document, which includes an informative description of classes and properties, gives examples and data provider rules, and provides more schema and instance diagrams.\n\n## Overview\nThe figure below gives an overview of the ontology, depicting the main classes and their relationships (i.e., object properties). The ontology covers the following areas:\n\n- Registered Organization: To represent a legal company.\n\n- Identifier System: To represent Identifier Systems. A company can have several Identifiers belonging to different Identifier Systems.\n\n- Officer: To represent associated company officers, e.g., directors.\n\n- Dataset: To represent information about datasets that are offered by company data providers.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-overview.png)\n\n### Registered Organization (company)\nRegistered organizations are the main entities for which information is captured in the euBusinessGraph ontology. The ontology is not concerned with unregistered informal groups. Registered organizations gain legal entity status by the act of registration and are distinct from the broader concept of organizations, groups or, in some jurisdictions, sole traders. The figure below shows the classes and properties for representing core data about a registered organization.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-company-classes.png)\n\n### Identifier System\nMechanisms to identify companies in various data sources are essential in integration of data about companies across data sources. A proper understanding of what kind of systems of identifiers can be used for companies is thus necessary in this context. We analyzed various types of identifiers commonly used for companies and collected various properties of the systems they are part of. We modelled identifiers and identifier systems explicitly in the ontology as shown in thew figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-identifier-classes.png)\n\n### Officer\nWe use the membership model of the W3C Organization Ontology in a straightforward way to represent officer data as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-officer-classes.png)\n\n### Dataset Descriptions\nData consumers need to know how many companies are included in a data provider dataset, from which jurisdictions, and what depth of data is included (e.g., which properties, addresses with what geo resolution, etc.). We thus need to express both metadata about the dataset itself, and fine-grained statistics about the content of a dataset, as shown in the figure below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/euBusinessGraph/eubg-data/master/model/images/ontology-dataset-classes.png)\n\n" <http://data.businessgraph.io/ontology#> .
