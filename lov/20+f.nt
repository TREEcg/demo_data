<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/DualNumber> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The dual quantifies the denotation of the nominal element by specifying that there are exactly 'two' (as in Upper Sorbian, see [Corbett 2000: 20] for examples and discussion. Additionally, but not necessarily, this value may be assigned on the basis of the formal properties of the nominal element (as in dualia tantum, e.g. mangautek 'scissors' in the Yukon dialect of Central Alaskan Yupik; [Jacobson 1984: 226]). The use of the dual varies across languages which have this value. In some languages, dual may be used to refer to any two entities, but in others it must refer to a natural pair such as eyes, and still in others it must refer to two items unless they are a natural pair [Corbett 2000].
