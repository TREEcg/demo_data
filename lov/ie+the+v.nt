<https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/contributedLuminousFlux> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Luminous flux is a photometric measure of radiant flux, i.e. the volume of light emitted from a light source. Luminous flux is measured either for the interior as a whole or for a part of the interior (partial luminous flux for a solid angle). All other photometric parameters are derivatives of luminous flux. Luminous flux is measured in lumens (lm). The luminous flux is given as a nominal value for each lamp. Usually measured in Lumen (lm, Candela Steradian)."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .

<https://saref.etsi.org/saref4inma/Measurement> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A subclass of saref:Measurement that represents the measured value made over a property. It is also linked to the unit of measure in which the value is expressed and the timestamp of the measurement. The saref4imna:Measurement can be linked to individual Batches or Items. Moreover, the Measurement can be an ExpectedMeasurement (i.e. the value which is planned) or the ActualMeasurement (i.e. the value measured during production), which enables to check for deviations between the planned and actual values." <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4inma/> .
