<http://harmonet.org/harmonise.rdfs#Gastro> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Gastro aggregated concept is the primary food and drink entity. A gastro is in one location and is managed by one organisation. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if a gastro is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple gastros. Also, if a single establishment includes two different offerings (e.g. a bar, with basic bar food, and a restaurant with a la carte gourmet offerings), this is treated as two gastros, which are related to one another.\nA gastro may consist of a restaurant, a pub, a mountain hut, a sandwich shop, or any other form of location which provides prepared food or drink for consumption on or off the premises. \n\nA gastro has much in common with an accommodation, such as a location, an organiser, etc. However, it also has many attributes of its own, particularly those which focus on the food and drink available in the gastro. \n\nThe key attributes of a gastro, which differ from those of an accommodation are \n-\tThe gastroType of the gastro \n-\tThe cuisine served (which may be primarily drink, in some cases)\n-\tThe profile values (e.g. whether or not outside catering is provided, whether picnics are allowed, etc.)\n-\tThe facility values (e.g. whether there are separate childrenâ€™s dining areas, whether there is a smoking room, etc.)\nThe profile and facility values are considered as extensions to the existing (accommodation) profile and facility values." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .

It is designed to yield high modeling power and elasticity to cope with the huge variety in funding and project practices, which makes it applicable to many areas where funding is an important aspect: first of all research, but also the arts, cultural conservation, and many others." <https://w3id.org/dingo/> .
