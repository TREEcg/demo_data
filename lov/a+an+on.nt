These observations are made on climate proxies in various geological (e.g. lake or marine sediments, living or fossil coral reefs, cave deposits), glaciological (ice cores or snow pits) or biological (trees) archives. Many types of measurements can be made on each archives, each sensing a different aspect of the environment (sometimes, several aspects at once). A paleoclimate dataset is a set of observations made on an archive."@en <http://linked.earth/ontology#> .
