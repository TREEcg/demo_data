The intermediate node between the distribution of dataset B and dataset A has a property cdc:hadDistributionRole pointing to cdc:complementLink. \n\nWhen the dataset B is the result of both additions and deletions on dataset A, dataset B should have a direct distribution with two subdistributions (cdc:hasSubDistribution): one containing triples to be deleted (cdc:DeletetionDistribution) from the source dataset and another containing triples that should be added (cdc:AdditionDistribution) to the source dataset.
