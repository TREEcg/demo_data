The range should be constrained to Boolean. Agents, for which the value is True, correspond to instances of http://www.cyc.com/2003/04/01/cyc#LegalAgent, which is defined as follows \"Each instance of #LegalAgent is an agent who has some status in a particular legal system. At the very least, such an agent is recognized by some legal authority as having some kinds of rights and/or responsibilities as an agent (e.g., #citizens of Germany), ... \". In PROTON, it is modeled as property in order to avoid multiple-inheritance of classes and/or multiple classifications of instances."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .
