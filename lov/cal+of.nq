Chlorophyll is the green pigment found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria.  The presence of chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis to take place.  There are five different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally.  All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies.  The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms.  'Calcareous phytoplankton' are phytoplankton that produce calcite. Calcite is a mineral that is a polymorph of calcium carbonate. The chemical formula of calcite is CaCO3.
