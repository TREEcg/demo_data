For binding features this is the binding site and for fragment features this is the location of the fragment on the \"base\" sequence.\nOne feature may have more than one location, used e.g. for features which involve sequence positions close in the folded, three-dimensional state of a protein, but non-continuous along the sequence.\nSmall Molecules can have binding features but currently it is not possible to define the binding site on the small molecules. In those cases this property should not be specified." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
