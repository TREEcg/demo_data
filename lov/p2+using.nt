The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Details of methods and devices are best handled as free text, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon 14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of:) E55 Type.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of height of silver cup 232 on the 31st August 1997\n- the carbon 14 dating of the \"Schoeninger Speer II\" in 1996 [an about 400.000 years old Palaeolithic complete wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany in 1995]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE16(x) ⊃ E13(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
