Typically for a journal article, the Definitive Version results from revision of an earlier submitted version of the work following peer review, and is then published in print and/or digital form after the publisher has assigned it a DOI.  The Definitive Version is also known as the Version of Record, although according to the CrossRef Glossary (http://crossref.org/02publishers/glossary.html) that term can also refer to the author's final version of a work that is not formally published.

For example, the Aggregation may consist of the resources which, together, make up a journal article which has a DOI assigned to it. The Aggregation is not the article to which the DOI was assigned, but is a representation of it in some manner." <http://www.openarchives.org/ore/terms/> .
