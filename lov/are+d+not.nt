<http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#Workflow> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A wfdesc:Workflow is a directed graph in which the nodes are wfdesc:Process instances and the edges (wfdesc:DataLink instances) represent data dependencies between the constituent wfdesc:Process descriptions.\n\nThe resource that contains the wfdesc:WorkflowDefinition (say the XML file saved from a workflow designer tool) can be specified with wfdesc:hasWorkflowDefinition. Research objects might aggregate a wfdesc:Workflow, a wfdesc:WorkflowDefinition, or (recommended) both.\n\nA wfdesc:Workflow defines associated wfdesc:Process using wfdesc:hasSubProcess. A specialisation of this property is wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow, signifying that the process is a wfdesc:Workflow itself, which is further described in a similar fashion.\n\nAs a subclass of wfdesc:Process a wfdesc:Workflow can also define wfdesc:hasInput/wfdesc:hasOutput parameters - these would be inputs taken at workflow execution time, and final outputs of the workflow. (Note: Not all dataflow systems have this concept of workflow parameters)\n\nwfdesc:Parameter descriptions are linked using wfdesc:DataLink descriptions associated with the wfdesc:Workflow using wfdesc:hasDataLink.\n\nA wfdesc:Parameter defined with wfdesc:hasInput on a wfdesc:Workflow is considered an wfdesc:Input \"outside\" the workflow (ie. if it is a subworkflow), but an wfdesc:Output \"inside\" the workflow (where it can be connected to a wfdesc:Input of a wfdesc:Process). Thus such parameters can be linked \"through\" the workflow without having a \"mirrored\" port inside.\n\n\nExample:\n\n```\n@prefix wfdesc: <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc#> .\n:outerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubWorkflow :innerWorkflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasSubProcess :procA, :procC .\n\n:procA a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param1 .\n\n:procC a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param2 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param3 .\n\n\n:innerWorkflow a wfdesc:Workflow ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param4 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param5 ;\n  wfdesc:hasProcess :procB .\n\n:procB a wfdesc:Process ;\n  wfdesc:hasInput :param6 ;\n  wfdesc:hasOutput :param7 .\n\n:innerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param4; wfdesc:hasSink :param6 ],\n   [ wfdesc:hasSource :param7; wfdesc:hasSink :param5 ] .\n\n:outerWorkflow wfdesc:hasDataLink\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param1; wfdesc:hasSink :param4 ],\n  [ wfdesc:hasSource :param5; wfdesc:hasSink :param2 ] .\n```\n\n\nIn this example :param1 is the output of :procA. :param1 is the source in a datalink that goes to the input :param4 of the :innerWorkflow. :param4 is however also the source of an inner datalink, going to input :param6 of the nested :procB.\n\nFrom this :param4 is both an wfdesc:Input and wfdesc:Output (which is why these two classes are not disjoint)"@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfdesc> .
