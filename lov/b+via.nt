<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#ComplexAssembly> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A conversion interaction in which a set of physical entities, at least one being a macromolecule (e.g. protein, RNA, DNA), aggregate to from a complex physicalEntity. One of the participants of a complexAssembly must be an instance of the class Complex. The modification of the physicalentities involved in the ComplexAssembly is captured via BindingFeature class.\n\nUsage: This class is also used to represent complex disassembly. The assembly or disassembly of a complex is often a spontaneous process, in which case the direction of the complexAssembly (toward either assembly or disassembly) should be specified via the SPONTANEOUS property. Conversions in which participants obtain or lose CovalentBindingFeatures ( e.g. glycolysation of proteins) should be modeled with BiochemicalReaction.\n\nSynonyms: aggregation, complex formation\n\nExamples: Assembly of the TFB2 and TFB3 proteins into the TFIIH complex, and assembly of the ribosome through aggregation of its subunits." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
