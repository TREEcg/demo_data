A Value can e.g. be observed or influenced by devices, or it constitutes static data about a Thing.\nE.g. the indoor temperature of the room could be a Value of a Thing \"room\".\nA Value of a thing can concern a certain Aspect, e.g. the indoor temperature concerns the Aspect \"Temperature\" that could be measured by a temperature sensor.\nA Value of a Thing can have meta data" <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .

It can\n            be a set of states bordering a timeline (i.e., the state of affairs holding before and\n            after the timeline) or it can be the state of affairs that holds before and after a plan\n            (in this case, it represents the plan precondintions and effects). The\n            isTimelinePreconditionOf (isTimelineEffectOf) property connects a ConsistentStateSet\n            with a Timeline. The isPlanPreconditionOf (isPlanEffectOf) property connects a\n            ConsistentStateSet with a Plan. A ConsistentStateSet has one or more states as its\n            members (hasMember property)" <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
