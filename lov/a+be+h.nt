<http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19156/2011/observation#Process> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The class OM_Process (Figure 2) is an instance of the «metaclass» GF_FeatureType (ISO 19109:2005), which therefore represents a feature type. OM_Process is abstract, and has no attributes, operations or associations. It serves as the base class for observation processes. The purpose of an observation process is to generate an observation result. An instance of OM_Process is often an instrument or sensor, but may be a human observer, a simulator, or a process or algorithm applied to more primitive results used as inputs. \r\n\r\nNOTE\tISO 19115-2:2008 provides MI_Instrument, LE_Processing and LE_Algorithm, which could all be modelled as specializations of OM_Process. OGC SensorML [10] provides a model which is suitable for many observation procedures." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19156/2011/observation> .
