<http://www.onem2m.org/ontology/Base_Ontology/base_ontology#Thing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Thing in oneM2M  (Class: Thing) is an entity that can be identified in the oneM2M System. \nA Thing that is not a Device is not able to conmmunicate electronically with its environment. However, the sub-class of Thing that is able to interact electronically is called a \"Device\".\nA Thing may have ThingProperties (Object Property: hasThingProperty). A Thing can have relations to other things (Object Property: hasThingRelation).\nSince a Thing that is not a Device is not able to conmmunicate electronically it cannot influence the value of its ThingProperties or being influenced by it. Similarly a Thing cannot document its - real-world - relationships (via hasThingRelation) to other Things.\n\nE.g. A room that is modelled in oneM2M would be a Thing that could have a room-temperature as a ThingProperty and could have a relationship \"isAdjacentTo\" to another room" <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .
