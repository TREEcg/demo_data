It describes identification of resources on the Web, through the definition of relationships between resources and their representations on the Web. The requirement is to describe what can be identified by URIs and how this is handled e.g. in form of HTTP requests and reponds." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/web/irw.owl> .

<http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/muo#SimpleDerivedUnit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Units that are derived from exactly one base unit. There are two main possibilities. On one hand, there are units that are derived by adding a prefix to the unit. The prefix is a name or associated symbol (e.g. kilo) that precedes a unit of measure (e.g. meter) to form a decimal multiple or submultiple (e.g. Kilometer). Derived units, obtained by the application of a prefix, measure the same physical quality as its base unit. On the other hand, there are another kind of simple derived units that are also obtained from exactly one base unit but they measure a different physical quality. They are obtained by changing the exponent of the unit in the dimensional equation. For instance, this is how square meters are derived from meters. This exponent is represented in MUO with the datatype property muo:dimensionalSize. Combining this two patterns we can represent units that are obtained from a prefix and that have a dimension size different from 1, for instance, the unit square kilometer."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .
