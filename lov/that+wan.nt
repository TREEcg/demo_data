The Service exposes the Functionality to the network and makes it discoverable, registerable and remotely controllable in the network. \nA Service is offered by a device that wants (a certain set of) its Functionalities to be discoverable, registerable, remotely controllable by other devices in the network. \nA Service can expose one or more Functionalities and a Functionality can be exposed by one or more Services.\nThe Input- and Output DataPoints and Operations of a Service may have the same names as for a different Service, however the Service to which they belong differentiates how they are addressed in the Device (e.g. via a port specific to the Service).\nNOTE: While a Functionality  describes the – human understandable – meaning of a Service of the device the Service is used to describe how such functionality is represented in a communication network and can be accessed by electronic means. The Service and its Operations is therefore dependent on the technology of the network, hard- and software of the device." <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .
