<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An ontology of topics as used in thesauri, subject directories, etc.\nTopic is classified as a subclass of Collection, since its extensional semantics can be intended as a set of social objects (e.g. texts, concepts, other collections, relational meanings, etc.). Its intensional semantics is intended as an area of knowledge (or culture).\n\nThe ontology is partly based on Chris Welty's formal ontology of subjects (DKE, 1999). Subtopic, near, and far relations are pretty similar to the ones defined there. The main differences are:\n- topics are intended here as collections of social objects, not as regions; there is anyway a morphism to the mereo-topological notion of Welty's, since for each topic as a collection we can define a topic space (a subclass of dul:Region) that corresponds to Welty's topics;\n- subjects in Welty's ontology, which are points in a topic region, are intended here in two ways:\n(1) as a dul:SocialObject that hasTopic a Topic. A dul:SocialObject in this case contains references to any entity that (in Welty's terms) 'is about' a topic\n(2) as a Subject, which is characterized here as a subclass of Topic, which isTopicOf exactly 1 dul:SocialObject\n\nFor example, in Welty's theory, given a football event, there can be a subject for that event that is a point in the space of a topic, e.g. 'football'. In this ontology, this is represented as a dul:Event (the actual football event) that dul:isReferenceOf some dul:InformationObject (e.g. a report or article about the football event); such information object hasTopic a Topic (e.g. football). \nTherefore, this solution has specific counterparts to Welty's theory, although the intuition is very different: Welty's topics correspond here to Topic(s), Welty's subjects correspond here to parts of Topic(s), and Welty's individual entities in a domain ontology correspond here to any Entity that dul:isReferenceOf a dul:InformationObject that dul:expresses a dul:SocialObject that hasTopic a Topic.\n\nOn the other hand, a geometrical conception of topics, for example the one assumed by LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis), might take advantage from the addition of topic spaces into the ontology, because one could use dimensional space operators, as well as take input and produce outputs into an ontology by reasoning over topic spaces.\nFor this reason, in this version of the ontopic ontology, we also provide the classes TopicSpace and SubjectSpace, and link them to Topic(s) through the relation dul:isRegionFor; the advantage is that we have a dual encoding of topics, which get either a commonsensical semantics as collections of documents, notions, or any other dul:SocialObject, or a mereotopological semantics as dul:Region(s). The second semantics can be used jointly with LSA geometrical semantics." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo> "Version 1.2\nChanges in 1.1: added a dimensional space to topics that follows Welty's theory: the new classes are TopicSpace and Subject.\nChanges in 1.2: added English labels. Added abstract topic spaces and subjects as from Welty's formal ontology of subject.\nAdded in 1.3: difference between Subject and SubjectSpace, which reflects that between Topic and TopicSpace.\nAdded in 1.4: the notion of TopicalSignature, which refers to the set of lmm1:Expression(s) that can populate a Topic. E.g. the entries from Roget's, Moby, SenseCorpus, etc. are signatures for a Topic.\nChanges in 1.5: changed domain of hasTopic property to dul:Entity, added subproperty axioms for topic-oriented properties" <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl#Topic> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A topic, or subject, argument, domain, theme, subject area, etc.\nTopics have a controversial intuition across common sense, document management systems, knowledge organization systems, etc.\nHere we conceptualise a semiotic notion of iol:Topic as 'a (usually potential) dul:Collection of dul:SocialObject(s). \nFor example, 'music' is a topic constituted by the set of social objects that are associated with music-related entities. Such social objects can be information objects (texts, documents, words, images) about music-related entities, concepts classifying music-related entities, descriptions of musical theories and systems, etc.\nThe relation between social objects and topics is called here 'hasTopic', and is a rdfs:subPropertyOf dul:isMemberOf\nSpecific topics for e.g. a conversation or an article (therefore, closer to the notion of 'title' or 'entry') are called Subject(s).\n\nThere is an interesting duality of topics: they are commonly interpreted as areas of shared knowledge within a Community (therefore as collections of social objects). On the other hand, existing directories and thesauri use 'topic' (or 'subject') more restrictively, as a relation between a document and a concept. \nThere is a sense of 'meaning' that can be reduced to the one given here to Topic (cf. the comment at the property dul:expresses), but in general there seems to be enough room to distinguish carefully between concepts and topics. \nFor example, thesauri do not usually distinguish when their 'concepts' (cf. skos:Concept) are actually intended as concepts (in the sense of dul:Concept) and when they are intended as topics. The distinction is clear when you compare these two sample sentences: 'the football topic is part of the sport topic' vs. 'the concept of football is part of the concept of sport'. \nWhile the first is perfectly acceptable, the second is counterintuitive and even possibly wrong. This effect is due to the fact that concepts are 'intensional' notions and are not intended as areas of knowledge, document spaces, etc., which are 'extensional' notions.\nAccordingly to these basic observations, in this ontology dul:Concept and Topic result to be disjoint, and an appropriate representation should be in place in order to model thesauri. E.g. skos:Concept should be mapped to the union of dul:Concept and Topic." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .
