A researcher may use a laboratory notebook to document hypotheses, to describe experiments and to record data in various formats, to provide details of data analysis and interpretation, or to record the validation or invalidation of the original hypotheses. The laboratory notebook serves as an organizational tool and a memory aid.  It may also have a role in recording and protecting any intellectual property created during the research, and may be used in evidence when establishing priority of discoveries, for example in patent applications.  Electronic versions of laboratory notebooks are increasingly being employed by researchers, particularly in chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry."@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
