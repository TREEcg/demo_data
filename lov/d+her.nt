<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Goal> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Goal class represents the objectives of an agent. In the BDI model, the\n            agent is driven by her desires, or goal, and forms plans to achieve them. In Drammar, a\n            goal is achieved by a plan; the achives object property connects a plan with the goal it\n            achieves (a single goal, since the achieves property is functional). An agent intends\n            (intends object property) a goal. Formally, the Goal class is a defined as a subclass of\n            the MentalState class which is constrained: - to be the goal of some agent - to be part\n            of some ConsistentStateState - to be described by a GoalSchema Goal has a propositional\n            content that is - a process in the case of perform goal PG (Hamlet wants to ask Ophelia\n            ...) - a state in the case of - achievement (Hamlet wants Ophelia goes to a nunnery) -\n            maintenance (Hamlet wants Claudius (keeps) believing Hamlet is mad) - query (Hamlet\n            wants to know whether Ophelia is honest) In these various cases the propositional\n            content is different: - Perform Goal - PC: Action - AG - PC: State, embedded in one\n            Belief, with status false or Process, embedded in Belief, with accomplishment false - MG\n            - PC: State or Process, embedded in Belief, with status/accomplishment true - Query Goal\n            - PC: depends on query; e.g.: - Y/N question: the boolean status of a state (currently\n            implemented as a State with status TRUE) - Wh question: the filler of a role in some\n            state or process (currently not implemented) These are guidelines for writing the plans\n            correctly." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Agent> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Agent. Derived from BDI model, a mentalist model of agent which sees the agent\n            as a rational entity who form intentions, or plans, (based on her beliefs) to achieve\n            her desires (or goals). See Bratman et al. 1988 and Cohen and Levesque 1995. Agents are\n            those entities in drama, that potentially - have goals (object property hasGoal); -\n            intend plans to achieve goals (object property intends); - participate in actions with\n            some role (object property isFillerOf); In addition, agents have emotional states (as a\n            result of targeted emotions appraisal processes) and have moral values (hasValue): -\n            feel emotions as a result of a cognitive appraisal process (specific object properties\n            link each the appraisal of each emotion type to the agent); - have values (object\n            property hasValue); The requirement, in drama, is that an agent has a plan, since the\n            fact of having a goal would not be sufficient to ensure that the goal is translated into\n            some concrete, perceivable behavior in drama. Having a plan, instead, implies that the\n            agent also has goal. Notice that some Agent (e.g. Polonius) is involved in an action\n            without being intentional (e.g., being the topic of a conversation), it remains\n            classified as an Agent in Drammar, though it fills a different role in the frame (e.g.,\n            Topic of Conversation).
