In many cities, private\nschools are a significant component of education in the city. Private\nschools shall be recognized as providing real, bona fide education; many\nministries or departments of education have a program that recognizes\nsuch schools. Enrolment in religious schools and home schools should be\nincluded if they are recognized.\n\nOne part-time enrolment of a half-day or more shall be counted as a\nfull-time enrolment.\n\nIf the geographies of school districts and the city are different, best\njudgment should be used to relate enrolment data to the city boundaries."@en <http://ontology.eil.utoronto.ca/ISO37120.owl> .
