<http://spinrdf.org/spin#TableDataProvider> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An abstraction of objects that can produce tabular data. This serves as a base class of spin:SelectTemplate, because SELECT queries can produce tables with columns for each result variable. However, other types of TableDataProviders are conceivable by other frameworks, and this class may prove as a useful shared foundation.\n\nTableDataProviders can link to definitions of columns via spin:column, and these definitions can inform rendering engines." <http://spinrdf.org/spin> .
