Those who check proofs include the editor, possibly the peer-reviewers (to ensure that their requested modifications have been included to their satisfaction), possibly an in-house professional proof-reader, and / or the author, who is ultimately responsible for ensuring the published work says what (s)he means it to say.  Substantive changes to the text are not permitted once the manuscript has reached proof stage."@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
