The registration is therefore a fundamental relationship between a the organization and the authority with \n      which it is registered. The details of the registration are provided as properties of the Identifier class which is \n      defined by ADMS. The vocabulary sets no restriction on the type of legal identifier. In many countries, the business register's \n      identifier is the relevant data point. The tax number often fulfils this function in Spain and elsewhere.\n      Although there is no formal cardinality constraint on any property in the Registered Organization Vocabulary, it is \n      questionable whether a description of a registered organization without this property and an associated Identifier class will \n      be of any value."@en <http://purl.org/oslo/ns/localgov> .

<http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/examples/2> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "<p>\n\n      The relationship vocabulary can be used to describe relationships with the people linked from a web page. This is particularly useful for blogrolls or contact lists but can be used with any type of link. The HTML <code>a</code> element provides two attributes, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rel\">rel and rev</a>, that can be used to specify the relationship. Both <code>rel</code> and <code>rev</code> take a space separated list of keywords as their value. To use a term from the relationship vocabulary just drop the <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> namespace to leave the property name, e.g. <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/worksWith</code> would become <code>worksWith</code> which can be added as the value of <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code>.\n    </p>\n    <dl>\n      <dt>\n        <code>rel</code>\n      </dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>\n          The <code>rel</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linked</em> page has with the author of the <em>linking</em> page.\n          For example:\n        </p>\n        <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rel</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n        <p>This link states that the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code> is a child of the author of the html above. </p>\n      </dd>\n      <dt>\n        <code>rev</code>\n      </dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>\n          The <code>rev</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linking</em> page has with the author of the   <em>linked</em> page. The example here is:\n        </p>\n        <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rev</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n        <p>In this case the meaning of the link is reversed: the author of the html above is a child of the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code>.</p>\n      </dd>\n    </dl>\n    <p>The HTML and XHTML recommendations require an HTML document to declare a custom profile if it uses any non-standard <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code> types. This is done by adding a <code>profile</code> attribute with a value of <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> to the document's <code>head</code> element. </p>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;head profile=\"http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>\n    <h3>Complete Example</h3>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;html profile=\"http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/\"&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Here are the people I know:&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~freddy\" rel=\"closeFriendOf\"&gt;Freddy (he's cool!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://frooble.com/\" rel=\"mentorOf\"&gt;Jimbo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mmmm.com/klm\" rel=\"friendOf\"&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~omah\" rel=\"worksWith\"&gt;Omah (does the coding)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~jason\" rev=\"closeFriendOf employedBy\"&gt;Jason, my henchman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n    <h3>RDF Interpretation</h3>\n    <p>Custom parsers that extract RDF from (X)HTML can use the relationships expressed in the links to infer the\n  equivilent RDF triples. It should be remembered that the relationship is between the authors of the pages not between\n  the pages themselves. Given the following link on a document at <code>http://example.com/mypage.html</code>:\n  </p>\n    <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rel</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n    <p>a suggested RDF extraction is:</p>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;foaf:Person&gt;\n    &lt;foaf:maker rdf:resource=\"http://example.com/boats\"/&gt;\n    &lt;rel:childOf&gt;\n      &lt;foaf:Person&gt;\n        &lt;foaf:maker rdf:resource=\"http://example.com/mypage.html\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;\n    &lt;/rel:childOf&gt;\n  &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;</code></pre>\n"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral> <http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/> .

<http://sw-portal.deri.org/ontologies/swportal#Location> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This class is the superclass for all classes defining geographical locations. The approach for this subontology is to have a hierarchy of location classes, such that instances of the classes further down in the hierarchy can be contained in instances of the classes higher up in the hierarchy. On each level, there exist two sister classes: class L defines a certain type of location, while class SubL defines locations which can be contained in instances of L. SubL then defines a property inL, to express which instance of L an instance of SubL is contained in. E.g. for a class Continent, there exists a class SubContinent. All children of SubContinent (either direct or transitive) define locations that can be contained in a continent, such as countries, regions, cities, etc. By virtue of inheritance, all these location classes then have a property inContinent, to express that they are contained in some continent. In a simpler, flat structure, inContinent would have to be defined explicitly for all kinds of locations that can be contained in a continent.\nThe intepretation of the inL predicates should be as follows: if, for a particular instance K, inL has a value, this value is valid. If inL has no value, the value of inL in the next location K is contained in valid, and so forth. E.g. an instance \"Hawaii\" has the value \"Oceania\" defined for <link>inContinent</link> and \"USA\" for <link>inCountry</link>. \"Delaware\" has no value for inContinent. \"USA\" has the value \"North America\" for <link>inContinent</link>. The interpretation would be that \"Hawaii\" is located in \"Oceania\", while \"Delaware\" is located in \"North America\".\nWe are aware of the fact that this approach is idealized and can therefore conflict with reality in some situations. E.g., the exact borders of continents are not always defined (there are contradicting opinions on where exactly Europe begins or ends). Countries could be contained in more than one continent (Turkey belongs to both Europe and Asia). However, we think that these situations are marginal and have little or no impact on the intended use of this ontology.\nWe think that this recursive modelling of locations is at the same time simple and powerful enough to capture all necessary aspects of the concept of location for a domain such as an SWPortal. While the SubL classes might appear to be somewhat artificial, they are actually not. They are just an abstraction for geographical entities that are (under normal circumstances) smaller than entities of type L. As such, they are no more abstract than, say, the concept of an agent.\n" <http://sw-portal.deri.org/ontologies/swportal> .

<https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/lampBallastType> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The type of ballast used to stabilise gas discharge by limiting the current during operation and to deliver the necessary striking voltage for starting. Ballasts are needed to operate Discharge Lamps such as Fluorescent, Compact Fluorescent, High-pressure Mercury, Metal Halide and High-pressure Sodium Lamps. Magnetic ballasts are chokes which limit the current passing through a lamp connected in series on the principle of self-induction. The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz)."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
