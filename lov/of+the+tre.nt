Scenes (as a type of TreeNode) form a hierarchy, which\n            represents the recursive nature of drama. This is obtained by implementing the Scene\n            class as a subclass of the TreeNode class. Scenes contains children scenes: this\n            relation is modeled through the hasChild property. All scenes span some timeline (spans\n            object property), i.e., they have a correspondance with some extent of the drama text\n            (represented by the Timeline class)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
