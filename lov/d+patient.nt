<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/AbsolutiveAntipassiveVoice> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A term used by some Mayanists to refer to an antipassive in which the patient or logical object is supressed or overtly absent. [Klaiman 1991: 232] Dayley states that the absolutive antipassive is used when the patient is unknown or irrelevant, or when the speaker does not wish to mention the patient, or to describe a transitive activity typically performed by some agent. The absolutive antipassive requires a non-specific implied patient, and no specific patient is ever semantically recoverable from the speech context. Only the absolutive antipassive has (as the name implies) absolutive function such that a transitive activity may be discussed without mention of the patient. [Dayley 1985: 345-350] This type of antipassive with an obligatorily unidentified object is also found in Mam, another Mayan language. [Cooreman 1994: 52-53]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
