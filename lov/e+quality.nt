<http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite#Observation> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#changeNote> "A new property oml:samplingStrategy is scoped to this class. In this  formulation, the (mandatory) feature-of-interest always refers to the ultimate feature of interest, whose type can carry the observed property, and the (optional) sampling strategy allows the sampling feature to be made explicit as an additional relationship. This overcomes some semantic sleight-of-hand in ISO 19156, in which the constraint the the observed property was commensurate with the feature-of-interest was allowed to be 'transitive' via the sampledFeature property." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite> .
