The green open-access version of the work may be a preprint (the version of the article as first submitted for publication) or a postprint (the pre-publication version of the article after incorporation of authors’ responses to peer reviewers’ comments).  Its availability may have an embargo restriction imposed by the publisher of the subscription-access version of the work, that prevents the green open-access version from being freely available until some substantial time after publication of the subscription-access journal issue containing that article.

The term Gratis Open Access thus signifies absence of a price barrier to view.  While both imply ‘free’ (a potentially ambiguous word), Gratis Open Access equates to ‘free as in beer’ while Libre Open Access (q.v.) equates to ‘free as in speech’.  Gratis Open Access is thus a necessary but not a sufficient condition for true Libre Open Access.   Many ‘open access’ publications by commercial scholarly publishers are only Gratis Open Access, while almost all publications by ‘pure’ Open Access scholarly publishers are Libre Open Access.
