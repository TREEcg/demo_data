<http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop#transitiveOver> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Makes possible the modelling of a specific, but rather useful modelling pattern. The semantics is defined with the following axiom: (p,transitiveOver,q) (x,p,y) (y,q,z) => (x,p,z). Sample usage is: (locatedIn, transitiveOver, subRegionOf) (Ontotext,locatedIn,Bulgaria) (Bulgaria,subRegionOf,Europe) => (Ontotext,locatedIn,Europe). The intended domain and range of this property are owl:ObjectProperty; those are not formally specified, in order not to get the ontology outside the OWL DL segment."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .
