[940mm]). Many tiny cells between two panels of glass hold an inert mixture of noble gases. The gas in the cells is electrically turned into a plasma which then excites phosphors to emit light.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"Digital newspaper technology - Plasma\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_newspaper_technology#Plasma) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .
