That is, not a quality of an abstract entity as is also allowed by DUL's Quality, but rather an aspect of an entity that is intrinsic to and cannot exist without the entity and is observable by a sensor, or operable by an actuator. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a property may also itself be a feature of interest. For example if a fridge uses alternative current energy, then several aspects of its energy consumption property may be quantified. Examples of such aspects include:\r\n\r\n- the active power consumption;\r\n- the reactive power consumption;\r\n- the phase of voltage relative to current;\r\n- the frequency;\r\n- the minimal operating value of the frequency;\r\n- the number of occurences of unusual values.\r\n\r\nThese are different properties of the same property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nex:activePower a owl:ObjectProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:subPropertyOf seas:hasProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:domain seas:PowerProperty ;\r\n  rdfs:range seas:PowerProperty .\r\n\r\n<fridge/1/consumption> a seas:FeatureOfInterest ;\r\n  ex:activePower <fridge/1/consumption/activePower> .\r\n```\r\n\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology> .

<https://w3id.org/seas/subSystemOf> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Links a system to its super system.\r\n\r\nProperties of subsystems somehow contribute to the properties of the super system. The exact meaning of _contribute_ is defined by sub properties of `seas:subSystemOf`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a fridge is a subsystem of a kitchen, then its consumption power contributes to the consumption power of the kitchen. \r\n\r\nProperty `seas:subSystemOf` is functional, and should be asymmetric:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif x seas:subSystemOf y1 and x seas:subSystemOf y2, then y1 and y2 refer to the same resource.\r\nif x seas:subSystemOf y, then it can't be the case that y seas:subSystemOf x.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe asymmetric aspect of property `seas:subSystemOf` would prevents a system from being its own sub-system. Unfortunately, OWL 2 DL disallow a non-simple property (e.g., a functional property) from being asymmetric, see OWL 2 Syntax section 11.\r\n\r\nIf it was possible that both the fridge and the kitchen be sub systems of a common super system, say, the house, then the consumption power of the fridge would contribute twice to the consumption power of the house. The functional aspect of property `seas:subSystemOf` prevents this undesired effect. \r\n\r\nDue to the open world assumption of RDF, it is not possible to model the closed set of sub systems of a system using property `seas:subSystemOf`.\r\n"@en <https://w3id.org/seas/SystemOntology> .
