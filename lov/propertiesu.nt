<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#Interaction> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A biological relationship between two or more entities. \n\nRationale: In BioPAX, interactions are atomic from a database modeling perspective, i.e. interactions can not be decomposed into sub-interactions. When representing non-atomic continuants with explicit subevents the pathway class should be used instead. Interactions are not necessarily  temporally atomic, for example genetic interactions cover a large span of time. Interactions as a formal concept is a continuant, it retains its identitiy regardless of time, or any differences in specific states or properties.\n\nUsage: Interaction is a highly abstract class and in almost all cases it is more appropriate to use one of the subclasses of interaction. \nIt is partially possible to define generic reactions by using generic participants. A more comprehensive method is planned for BioPAX L4 for covering all generic cases like oxidization of a generic alcohol.   \n\nSynonyms: Process, relationship, event.\n\nExamples: protein-protein interaction, biochemical reaction, enzyme catalysis" <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
