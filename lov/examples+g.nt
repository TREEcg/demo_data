<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#Pathway> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A set or series of interactions, often forming a network, which biologists have found useful to group together for organizational, historic, biophysical or other reasons.\n\nUsage: Pathways can be used for demarcating any subnetwork of a BioPAX model. It is also possible to define a pathway without specifying the interactions within the pathway. In this case, the pathway instance could consist simply of a name and could be treated as a 'black box'.  Pathways can also soverlap, i.e. a single interaction might belong to multiple pathways. Pathways can also contain sub-pathways. Pathways are continuants.\n\nSynonyms: network, module, cascade,  \nExamples: glycolysis, valine biosynthesis, EGFR signaling" <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
