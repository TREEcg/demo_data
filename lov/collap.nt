<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Unit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Unit Units are the segmentation of drama. A drama can have multiple\n            segmentations. Units are ordered by some Timeline. Units are devoted to the\n            representation of characters' actions. So, we require that any unit contains at\n            least one action whose description (ProcessSchema) encompasses at least one role having\n            an agent as a filler. If a building collapses, this action, by itself, can be part of\n            Unit only if an agent is involved in it (e.g., an agent dies). This definition\n            guarantees that, in the minimal case, at least one agent appears as filler of the roles\n            in the description of at least an action of every unit. A Unit has one or more actions\n            as its members (hasMember property)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

Notice that the notion of timeline cannot be collapsed\n            onto the actual text: rather, it is simply an indexing posed upon units (which\n            correspond to a manifestation of drama in FRBR sense). In formal terms, the orders\n            object property has Timeline as its domain and units as its range, so a unit\n            \"orders\" some units. A Timeline contains unit. Formally, the elements\n            (OrderedListElements class) contained in a timeline (containsOLE property) are units. A\n            Timeline is surrounded by states of affairs that hold before and after it, namely\n            instances of the ConsistentSateSets class that precede and follow a given timeline.\n            Formally, the Timeline class is the domain of the hasTimelineEffect(Precondition)\n            properties, which have the ConsistentStateSet class as their range. A timeline is\n            motivated by some plan (motivates object property) and is spanned by some unit (span\n            object property). The relation between units and timelines is independent of the\n            scene/timeline relation." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
