<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/VelaricProperty> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Velaric refers to an air-stream mechanism wherein the air is generated by a closure at the velar position, rather than an air-stream generated by the lungs. The back of the tongue is raised against the velum, and articulations are made farther forward by the lips or front parts of the tongue, drawing air into or pushing air out of the mouth. The clicks of some African languages are produced in this way. In English, they may be heard in the 'tut tut' sound.
