<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Process> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Processes represents the dynamic class of the perdurants: they are gathered\n            into units, which are contained into ordered timelines bordered by states. Process is\n            the class that bridges to the concept of Process in upper ontologies, externally to\n            Drammar (like DOLCE, where States and Processes are types of Statives: here, we include\n            also the event types called accomplishments and achievements in DOLCE). Consider that\n            such resources are not of linguistic type. The DescriptionTemplate class (or, better,\n            its subclass FrameNetSchema), in fact, drives the behavior of the process inside a Plan\n            or a Unit, linking it (via the ExternalReference Class) to: 1. a Wordnet sense 2. a\n            Frame (from Framenet or Verbnet) 3. a set of Roles, played by roles encompassed in the\n            frame All these links are bridged by the ExternalReference Class, which has\n            \"quale\" properties that link the reference to specific resources. In the\n            external ontology, a process may be logically defined through the use of axioms: for\n            example, in the action of asking, it is assumed that Speaker and Addressee are connected\n            through some communication medium, e.g. co-presence in a room or a telephone. In\n            Drammar, the DramaStructures that contain the Processes are Units (subclasses of\n            DramaSets) and Plans (subclasses of DramaLists). They are then subdivided through a\n            further trait, that is whether the process is intentional (of an agent) or not (Action\n            or UnintentionalProcess). This trait is defined through a specific Datatype property, of\n            boolean type, called isIntentional. So, its subclasses are: - Action: with isIntentional\n            property valued TRUE; - UnintentionalProcess: with isIntentional property valued FALSE.\n            Same happens in parallel to the States, although in that case the trait concerns the\n            state schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
