<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E78_Collection> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (\"curated\" and \"preserved,\" in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan.\n\nItems may be added or removed from an E78 Collection in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Collection often referred to with the name of the E78 Collection (e.g. \"The Wallace Collection decided…\").\n\nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Collection. This is because they form wholes either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.\n\nExamples:\n- The John Clayton Herbarium\n- the Wallace Collection\n- Mikael Heggelund Foslie's coralline red algae Herbarium at Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE78(x) ⊃ E24(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

It allows for a better understanding of *why* something might have taken place, have been used or produced than the more generic [PROV ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), on which it is mainly based, does.  \n\n                                  The specialised decision modelling elements of this ontology have been derived from the [W3C Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group](https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/decision/)'s Decision Ontology (DO) which can be found at <https://github.com/nicholascar/decision-o>. Many DO classes have been aligned with the PROV-O since it is widely recognised that analysing the elements of decisions *post hoc* is an exercise in provenance.\n\n                                  Unlike the original DO, this ontology cannot be used for *normative* scenarios: it is only capable of recording decisions that have already been made (so-called *data-driven* use in the DO). This is because PROV does not have a templating system which can indicate what *should* occur in future scenarios.\n\n                                  This ontology introduces only one new element for decision modelling over that which was present in the DO: an Agent which allows agency in decision making to be recorded."@en <http://promsns.org/def/decprov> .
