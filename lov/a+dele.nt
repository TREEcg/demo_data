<https://w3id.org/GConsent#Delegation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Delegation of consent occurs when another entity, whether a data subject or their representative or an automated mechanism, provides the consent on behalf of the intended Data Subject. The delegated consent is provided through the mechanism of a _delegation_. This involves three entities - the Data Subject the delegation occurs for, the entity that acts as the delegate, and the mechanism used to verify the authority to delegate. They (first two) are provided respectively by the properties `isConsentDelegationFor`, and `hasConsentGivenByDelegate`."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
