The production of such information may have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.\n\nCharacteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.\nThey cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.\n\nExamples:\n- Beethoven's \"Ode an die Freude\" (Ode to Joy) (E73)\n- the definition of \"ontology\" in the Oxford English Dictionary\n- the knowledge about the victory at Marathon carried by the famous runner\n- 'Maxwell equations' [preferred subject access point from LCSH,\n http://lccn.loc.gov/sh85082387, as of 19 November 2012]\n- 'Equations, Maxwell' [variant subject access point, from the same source]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE28(x) ⊃ E71(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E6_Destruction> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.\n\nSome destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an E6 Destruction and E7 Activity.\n\nThe decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive:\n1.  If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as E6 Destruction.\n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as E11 Modification.\n\nExamples:\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD\n- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7)\n- the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE6(x) ⊃ E64(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
