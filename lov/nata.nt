It is a dynamic asymmetric relationship, where the range expresses the derivative, if such a direction can be established. Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. The relationship is not transitive.\n\nThe equivalence applies to all cases of use of an instance of E41 Appellation. Multiple names assigned to an object, which are not equivalent for all things identified with a specific instance of E41 Appellation, should be modelled as repeated values of P1 is identified by (identifies).\n\nP139.1 has type allows the type of derivation, such as “transliteration from Latin 1 to ASCII” be refined..\n\nExamples:\n- \"Martin Doerr\" (E41) has alternative form \"Martin Dörr\" (E41) has type Alternate spelling (E55)\n- \"Гончарова, Наталья Сергеевна\" (E41) has alternative form \"Gončarova, Natal´â Sergeevna\" (E41) has type ISO 9:1995 transliteration (E55)\n- \"Αθήνα\" has alternative form \"Athina\" has type transcription.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP139(x,y) ⊃ E41(x)\nP139 (x,y) ⊃ E41(y)\nP139(x,y,z) ⊃ [P139(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\nP139(x,y) ⊃ P139(y,x)\n\nProperties: P139.1 has type: E55 Type"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
