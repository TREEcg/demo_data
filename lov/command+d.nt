A command may act upon a state, but does not necessarily act upon a state. For example, the ON command acts upon the ON/OFF state, but the GET command does not act upon any state, it simply gives a directive to retrieve a certain value. We propose here a list of commands that are relevant for the purpose of SAREF, but this list can be extended."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/core/> .
