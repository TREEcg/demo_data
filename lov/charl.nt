It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc. In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.\nA digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of the manuscript page\nIt is an implicit transitive property.\n\nExamples:\t\n\n- The content of Charles-Moïse Briquet’s ‘Les Filigranes: dictionnaire historique des marques du papier’ (E32) P165 incorporates the visual aspect of the watermark used around 1358-61 by some Spanish papermaker(s) and identified as ‘Briquet 4019’ (E37)\n- The visual content of Jacopo Amigoni’s painting known as ‘The Singer Farinelli and friends’ (E38) P165 incorporates the musical notation of Farinelli’s musical work entitled ‘La Partenza’ (E73)\n- The visual content of Nicolas Poussin’s painting entitled ‘Les Bergers d’Arcadie’ (E38) P165 incorporates the Latin phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ (E33)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E73(x)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ E90(y)\nP165(x,y) ⊃ P106(x,y)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E26_Physical_Feature> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects.\n\nInstances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.\n\nInstances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.\n\nThis definition coincides with the definition of \"fiat objects\" (Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of \"bona fide objects\".\n\nExamples:\n- the temple in Abu Simbel before its removal, which was carved out of solid rock\n- Albrecht Duerer's signature on his painting of Charles the Great\n- the damage to the nose of the Great Sphinx in Giza\n- Michael Jackson's nose prior to plastic surgery\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE26(x) ⊃ E18(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
