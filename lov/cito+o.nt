<http://purl.org/spar/cito/Citation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A citation is a conceptual directional link from a citing entity to a cited entity, created by a human performative act of making a citation, typically instantiated by the inclusion of a bibliographic reference (biro:BibliographicReference) in the reference list of the citing entity, or by the inclusion within the citing entity of a link, in the form of an HTTP Uniform Resource Locator (URL), to a resource on the World Wide Web.\n\nThe time span of a citation, i.e. the interval between the publication year of the citing entity and the publication year of the cited entity, can be recorded using the data property cito:hasCitationTimeSpan.\n\nThe nature or type of a citation can be characterized by using CiTO object properties, e.g. http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsDataSource (definition: “The citing entity cites the cited entity as a source of data”).  \n\nThis CiTO class cito:Citation and its accompanying object properties cito:hasCitingEntity, cito:hasCitedEntity and cito:hasCitationCharacterization can be employed to reify direct citation statements made using the CiTO citation object property cito:cites or one of its sub-properties. \n\nFor example, the following RDF statement\n\n     :paperA cito:extends :paperB .\n\ncan be alternatively described as follows\n\n     :thisCitation a cito:Citation ; \n          cito:hasCitingEntity :paperA ;\n          cito:hasCitationCharacterization cito:extends ;\n          cito:hasCitedEntity :paperB .\n\nThis usage involved OWL2 punning, whereby a CiTO object property, such as the aforementioned cito:extends, is used as the object of the OWL assertion.\n\n     :thisCitation cito:hasCitationCharacterization cito:extends .\n\nUsing such OWL2 punning (described at http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-owl2-new-features-20090611/#F12:_Punning), the CiTO object property is considered as a proper named individual of the class owl:Thing. \n\nSuch reification of citation acts can be very useful, since it permits one to combine these CiTO properties with other vocabularies, or to handle situations in which none of the citation characterizations available in CiTO are applicable.  \n\nSuch situations can be resolved by the creation of a user-defined citation characterization, for example by using the Open Annotation Data Model, as explained at http://semanticpublishing.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/extending-cito-for-open-annotations/."@en <http://purl.org/spar/cito> .

<http://purl.org/spar/fabio> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, is an ontology for recording and publishing on the Semantic Web descriptions of entities that are published or potentially publishable, and that contain or are referred to by bibliographic references, or entities used to define such bibliographic references. FaBiO entities are primarily textual publications such as books, magazines, newspapers and journals, and items of their content such as poems, conference papers and editorials.  However, they also include blogs, web pages, datasets, computer algorithms, experimental protocols, formal specifications and vocabularies, legal records, governmental papers, technical and commercial reports and similar publications, and also anthologies, catalogues and similar collections. \n\nFaBiO classes are structured according to the FRBR schema of Works, Expressions, Manifestations and Items. Additional properties have been added to extends the FRBR data model by linking Works and Manifestations (fabio:hasManifestation and fabio:isManifestationOf), Works and Items (fabio:hasPortrayal and fabio:isPortrayedBy), and Expressions and Items  (fabio:hasRepresentation and fabio:isRepresentedBy)." <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .
