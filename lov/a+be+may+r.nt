Typically, instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).\n\nIn some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called \"bona fide objects\" (Smith & Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), i.e. naturally defined objects.\n\nThe decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be a purely administrative decision or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.\n\nExamples:\n- John Smith\n- Aphrodite of Milos\n- the Palace of Knossos\n- the Cullinan diamond\n- Apollo 13 at the time of launch\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE19(x) âŠƒ E18(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
