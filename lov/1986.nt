Aspiration involves matters of relativing timing between laryngeal and oral articulations, and the wider opening can be viewed as an aspect of the control of this timing. There are two ways of interpreting this greather width; it can be seen as the essential aspect of the production of voiceless aspiration, that is, aspiration is an extra-wide opening of the vocal folds [Kim 1965], or it can be seen as a by-product of the mechanism by which a delay between the offset of the oral and glottal gestures is achieved, that is, aspiration is esentially a matter of the timing between speech movements controlling laryngeal setting and oral articulation [Goldstein and Browman 1986].
