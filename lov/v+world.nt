<http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Procedure> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#example> "The measured wind speed differs depending on the height of the sensor above the surface, e.g., due to friction. Consequently, procedures for measuring wind speed define a standard height for anemometers above ground, typically 10m for meteorological measures and 2m in Agrometeorology. This definition of height, sensor placement, and so forth are defined by the Procedure."@en <http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/> .
