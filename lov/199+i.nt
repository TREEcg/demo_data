It has been argued that salience explains the evolution of certain syntactic changes, as well as the predominance of word orders where the subject precedes the object, due to the the salience of the agent in the agent-action-patient situation [Comrie 1989; Timberlake 1977]."@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
