<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/NeuterGender> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A gender property established on the basis of agreement, to which nouns may be assigned, either by a semantic rule, if they belong to the semantic residue of the assignment system, or by a formal rule, if assignment depends on inflectional class membership. Typically, this means that the neuter gender may cover some inanimates and possibly some portion of lower order animates. Note: Although in familiar Indo-European languages the term neuter gender may be part of a system with three or less values, it can be used for systems containing more than three gender values (e.g. Bininj Gunwok).

The Service exposes the Functionality to the network and makes it discoverable, registerable and remotely controllable in the network. \nA Service is offered by a device that wants (a certain set of) its Functionalities to be discoverable, registerable, remotely controllable by other devices in the network. \nA Service can expose one or more Functionalities and a Functionality can be exposed by one or more Services.\nThe Input- and Output DataPoints and Operations of a Service may have the same names as for a different Service, however the Service to which they belong differentiates how they are addressed in the Device (e.g. via a port specific to the Service).\nNOTE: While a Functionality  describes the – human understandable – meaning of a Service of the device the Service is used to describe how such functionality is represented in a communication network and can be accessed by electronic means. The Service and its Operations is therefore dependent on the technology of the network, hard- and software of the device." <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#MentalState> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "MentalStates are EventiveStates that are attributed to the mind of an agent.\n            There are four types of mental states: 1. Emotion 2. Belief 3. Goal 4. Value Belief and\n            Goal are traditionally described as having a propositional content because they both\n            concern some attitude of the agent toward a proposition; in Drammar, we don't\n            enforce this distinction because the reference theoriesd we adopt for emotion and values\n            also enforce some time of propositional content. The only difference is that only the\n            schema types for beliefs and goals (BeliefSchema and GoalSchema) have a propositional\n            content attached to it (through the propositionalContent object property). A MentalState\n            is defined as an EventiveState that is described by a MentalStateSchema. The latter are\n            to be specified as EmotionSchema, BeliefSchema, GoalSchema, ValueSchema,\n            depending on the MentalState type: so, the MentalStateSchema type works as a selector\n            for the right trait of the mental schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/NominalScale> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A nominal scale differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to; thus dichotomous data involves the construction of classifications as well as the classification of items. Discovery of an exception to a classification can be viewed as progress. Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the numbers do not have numerical value or relationship: For example, a Globally unique identifier. Examples of these classifications include gender, nationality, ethnicity, language, genre, style, biological species, and form. In a university one could also use hall of affiliation as an example."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
