The validation report node can be equal to the top node of a SHACL validation report RDF graph (e.g. owner requirements vs. design), or it can point to either two RDF datasets (cdc:onlyInSourceDS or cdc:onlyInTargetDS) containing the result of a subtraction (e.g. design vs. as-built) or a free text explanation of the comparison result (rdfs:comment)."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .

When a construction component or spatial zone is inspected and a damage is detected, the result of the inspection task is the damage description connected to the inspected object. Note that existing known damage, e.g. covered by previous inspections, can be the subject of subsequent inspection tasks."@en <https://w3id.org/cto> .
