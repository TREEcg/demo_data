<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl#Word> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A linguistic object consisting of a string (independently of its physical realization).\nIts topological unity can change according to its physical realization: as a written realization, its boundaries are blank spaces, as a spoken realization, sometimes is silence, sometimes not, and higher order features intervene.\nGrammatical notions, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc., are roles defined by a grammar, and words (or larger linguistic objects) can play those roles in a given language. E.g., the word 'share' can play both 'verb' and 'noun' roles in contemporary English, while the word 'come' can only play the 'verb' role in English, and the 'adverb' or 'conjunction' roles in Italian (but if we consider a word as only realized by phonemes, i.e. if we consider the oral realizations of 'come', there is no common word 'come' in the two languages)." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl> .
