This distinction was proposed by Corbett (1991) to account for the criteria according to which nouns can be allotted to genders. Corbett demonstrates that gender assignment systems in languages can be semantic or semantic-and-formal â€“ that is, the set of rules that determine the assignment of inherent gender values to nouns refer to the meaning of words, or a combination of the meaning of words and the form of words.
