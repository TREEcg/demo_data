If used in a transformation pattern for n-ary relations, the designer should take care of:\n- creating only one situation for each instance of an n-ary relation, otherwise the 'identification constraint' (Calvanese et al., IJCAI 2001) could be violated\n- adding an 'exact cardinality' restriction corresponding to the arity of the n-ary relation, otherwise the designer would actually represent a polymorphic relation." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/situation.owl> .
