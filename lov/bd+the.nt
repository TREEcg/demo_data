<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Goal> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Goal class represents the objectives of an agent. In the BDI model, the\n            agent is driven by her desires, or goal, and forms plans to achieve them. In Drammar, a\n            goal is achieved by a plan; the achives object property connects a plan with the goal it\n            achieves (a single goal, since the achieves property is functional). An agent intends\n            (intends object property) a goal. Formally, the Goal class is a defined as a subclass of\n            the MentalState class which is constrained: - to be the goal of some agent - to be part\n            of some ConsistentStateState - to be described by a GoalSchema Goal has a propositional\n            content that is - a process in the case of perform goal PG (Hamlet wants to ask Ophelia\n            ...) - a state in the case of - achievement (Hamlet wants Ophelia goes to a nunnery) -\n            maintenance (Hamlet wants Claudius (keeps) believing Hamlet is mad) - query (Hamlet\n            wants to know whether Ophelia is honest) In these various cases the propositional\n            content is different: - Perform Goal - PC: Action - AG - PC: State, embedded in one\n            Belief, with status false or Process, embedded in Belief, with accomplishment false - MG\n            - PC: State or Process, embedded in Belief, with status/accomplishment true - Query Goal\n            - PC: depends on query; e.g.: - Y/N question: the boolean status of a state (currently\n            implemented as a State with status TRUE) - Wh question: the filler of a role in some\n            state or process (currently not implemented) These are guidelines for writing the plans\n            correctly." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Plan> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Plan A plan is a sequence of actions devised by an agent to achieve some Goal.\n            In the BDI model, the agent's 'intention' to execute a plan is the bridge\n            between goals and practical actions. In Drammar, a plan is intended by (intendedBy\n            object property) an Agent to achieve (achieve property) some Goal. As a consequence, the\n            plan motivates (isMotivationFor object property) a timeline (i.e. a given extent of the\n            drama text). These are the necessary and sufficient conditions of class. Following the\n            paradigm of hierarchical planning, plans are recursive. So plans can contains actions or\n            other, simpler plans. Formally, a Plan is a list (namely, it is a subclass of the List\n            class) whose elements are simpler plans (for abstract plans) or actions (for directly\n            executable plans). A plan is related to its elements by the containsOLE\n            property." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

In Drammar there is no distinction\n            between knowing and believing, because reasoning concerns the agent motivations for\n            acting, rather than the relationship between single agent knowledge and shared\n            knowledge.
