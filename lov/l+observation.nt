This act can be performed during the context acquisition or context processing phases of a context aware system. An Observation links to a Sensor to describe what made the Observation and how; links to an ObservableProperty to describe what the result is an estimate of; and links to a FeatureOfInterest to detail what that property was associated with. When the act is made during the context processing phase the entry values of the procedure should be linked to the observation by the wasDerivedFrom property."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .
