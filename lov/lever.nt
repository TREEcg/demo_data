<http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot#> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "Many testbeds owning devices or applications interacting with the sensors, store their inherent observations and other related data in their own proprietary format. In other words, making a testbed independent and isolated from others that cannot directly interact with each other. Differences in the data format lead to interoperability issues between the testbeds and much work has to be done in order to ensure the compatibility. One has to understand different data formats and create the mapping between them. As a result, a testbed must understand other testbed's format and create the mapping both while sending and receiving information. One method to accomplish  interoperability is through the usage of semantic-based technologies to annotate all the information shared by the platforms. Nevertheless, some of the relevant existing ontologies promise interoperability but: \n\n- do not address the problem to describe the observation in an interoperable manner to ease further tasks, such as reasoning, \n- many of them are domain-specific and cannot be applied across domains, \n- they have missing concepts and do not suffice the needs of the measurements provided by the sensors, and \n- many ontologies do not follow best practices making it hard to correctly interpret and reuse concepts.\n\n\nIn order to address the above-mentioned limitations, we provide FIESTA-IoT ontology (a unified semantic model) that follows best practices. FIESTA-IoT Ontology is a merge of concepts from various ontologies such as IoT-lite, M3-lite Taxonomy, SSN, Time and DUL (see Figure 1). The FIESTA-IoT Ontology is diveded into 2 parts: resourse description and observations produced. One has to follow the Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively, for understanding what all concepts are associated with resourse description and observation. Using such information testbeds can annotate their data to FIESTA-IoT specific requirements and the annotators developed can achieve FIESTA-IoT certification.\n\n\nFor more detials please see:\n\n- R.

<http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot#> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "After a thorough analysis of existing Internet of Things (IoT) related ontologies, we propose FIESTA-IoT Ontology that aims to achieve semantic interoperability among heterogeneous testbeds. The Ontology is framed within the EU H2020's FIESTA-IoT project, that aims to seamlessly support the federation of testbeds through the usage of semantic-based technologies. The  FIESTA-IoT ontology takes inspiration from the well-known Noy et al. methodology  for reusing and interconnecting existing ontologies. To build the ontology, we leverage a number of core concepts from various mainstream ontologies and taxonomies, such as Semantic Sensor Network (SSN), M3-lite (a lite version of M3 ontology), WGS84, IoT-lite, Time, and DUL ontology.

The float may be a ball attached to a lever or other mechanism HYDRAULIC: A valve that is opened and closed by hydraulic actuation LEVER: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a lever rotating the gate within the valve. LOCKSHIELD: A valve that requires the use of a special lockshield key for opening and closing, the operating mechanism being protected by a shroud during normal operation. MOTORIZED: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of an electric motor on an actuator PNEUMATIC: A valve that is opened and closed by pneumatic actuation SOLENOID: A valve that is normally held open by a magnetic field in a coil acting on the gate but that is closed immediately if the electrical current generating the magnetic field is removed. SPRING: A valve that is normally held in position by the pressure of a spring on a plate but that may be caused to open if the pressure of the fluid is sufficient to overcome the spring pressure. THERMOSTATIC: A valve in which the ports are opened or closed to maintain a required predetermined temperature.
