The code lists are published separately at http://reference.data.gov.au/def/ont/iso19160-1-address/codelist.\n\nAdditionally, this version adds some metadata, such as this explanation, some further annotation properties to better display elements of the ontology and includes a human-readable (HTML) version of the ontology generated from the RDF version.\n\nAs the GOM's version of the ontology evolves, we will keep this version up-to-date as we intend to only publish an easier-to-access version of their ontology here, not to profile it."@en <http://reference.data.gov.au/def/ont/iso19160-1-address> .
