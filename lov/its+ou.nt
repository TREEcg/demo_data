This property allows a Time-Span’s maximum temporal extent (i.e. its outer boundary) to be assigned an E61 Time Primitive value. Time Primitives are treated by the CRM as application or system specific date intervals, and are not further analysed.\n\nExamples:\n- the time-span of the development of the CIDOC CRM (E52) at some time within 1992-infinity (E61)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP82 (x,y) ⊃ E52(x)\nP82 (x,y) ⊃ E61(y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
