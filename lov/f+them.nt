<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DescriptionTemplate> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DescriptionTemplate This class contains a well known role-based pattern for\n            representing the linguistic schemata that describe the elements of drama, such as the\n            entities and dynamics. Drammar imports this pattern from other ontologies, namely DOLCE.\n            The class DescriptionTemplate contains two classes: - Role - SituationSchema The class\n            SituationSchema provides the specific pattern for the description of incidents and\n            states, generically termed here as \"situations\". A situation can be either a\n            process or a state, usually described by a linguistic expression consisting of a verb\n            (\"giving\") for processes, such as in the expression \"Ophelia gives the\n            gift back to Hamlet\", or a by a preposition (\"behind\") for states, such\n            as in the expression \"Polonius is behind the tapestry\"). The Role class\n            provides the pattern for the roles that play a part in the state or process (in the\n            above example, the role of the \"donor\" filled by Ophelia, the role of the\n            \"recipient\" filled by Hamlet, etc.). The linguistic counterpart of the\n            role-based structure of the description templates is provided by a frame-like accounts\n            of the linguistic descriptions of events, such as Framenet or Verbnet\n            (https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml). Based on a lexical\n            semantics perspective, these initiatives are aimed at grouping verbs (including\n            statives) into \"frames of action\", i.e., linguistic structures representing a\n            group of semantically similar verbs with the complements that accompany them. Following\n            a design choice that characterizes the Drammar ontology, all references to the external\n            (linguistic or commonsense) knowledge are mediated by the ExternalReference class, a top\n            level class whose function is specifically to act as a bridge to the external knowledge\n            (see the documentation of the class). So, neither the Roles nor the Situation Schemata\n            directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge they assume: rather, the hasExtRef\n            property links each component of the pattern onto its corresponding class within the\n            ExternalReference class: the SituationSchema class is related to the ExternalRefSchema,\n            the Role class is related to the ExternalRefRole class. Each ExternalReference subclass,\n            then, bridges each pattern component onto the corresponding component within the\n            external knowledge source via a specific data type property." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
