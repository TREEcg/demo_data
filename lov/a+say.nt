Note that we do not say anything about whether the original agent still retain the thing-acted-on.  In some cases this is clearly true ('I pass my wisdom on to my daughter'), in other cases it is not (I give you my wallet)." <http://www.aktors.org/ontology/portal> .

<http://purl.org/pav/previousVersion> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The previous version of a resource in a lineage. For instance a news article updated to correct factual information would point to the previous version of the article with pav:previousVersion. If however the content has significantly changed so that the two resources no longer share lineage (say a new article that talks about the same facts), they can instead be related using pav:derivedFrom. This property is normally used in a functional way, although PAV does not formally restrict this. Earlier versions which are not direct ancestors of this resource may instead be provided using the superproperty pav:hasEarlierVersion. A version number of this resource can be provided using the data property pav:version. To indicate that this version is a snapshot of a more general, non-versioned resource, e.g. 'Weather Today' vs. 'Weather Today on 2013-12-07', see pav:hasVersion. Note that it might be confusing to indicate pav:previousVersion from a resource that also has pav:hasVersion or pav:hasCurrentVersion relations, as such resources are intended to be a long-living and 'unversioned', while pav:previousVersion is intended for use between permalink-like 'snapshots' arranged in a linear history."@en <http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#> .
