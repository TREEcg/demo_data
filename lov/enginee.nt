In Gangemi et al. 2002 \"Endurants are wholly present\n            (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present\",\n            differently from perdurants, which are only partially present at any time they are\n            present. Endurants (and Perdurants, in some cases) play a role in processes and states:\n            an Endurant is connected to a role (Role class) in the description of a given process or\n            state by the hasRole object property. The class of drama endurants encompasses more\n            specific drama entities such as Agent and Object. This bipartite distinction is derived\n            from the drama literature, where - Agents that intentionally perform actions; - Objects\n            are involved in the actions in an unintentional way. For instance, in Hamlet, the King\n            of England is a drama endurant (but non an agent) because it is the filler of a role in\n            Claudius' actions (sending ... ) but does not intend any plan (a feature would\n            locate it in the Agent class). The difference beteween the King of England and a coffee\n            machine is entrusted to common sense knowlegde (e.g., the external lexical knowledge\n            stating the sementic type of these two entities).

The DramaEdurant is the class of elements of Drama that describe the\n            story dynamics, i.e. Processes and States. In the context of Drammar, the individuals of\n            this class describe the story advancement in terms of incidents and states holding\n            between incidents. Each has a specific relation to the segmentation of drama: processes\n            are grouped in units, states precedes and follows timelines (which contain units).\n            Notice that processes and states are not distinct in Framenet, the knowledge source we\n            refer to for describing perdurants outside of Drammar.

<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/RatioScale> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has \"twice the length\" of another (= is \"twice as long\"). Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying \"how much\" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or \"how many\" (a count). The Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
