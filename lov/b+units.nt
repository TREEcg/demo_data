<http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#GeometryRestructuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The GeometryRestructuration concept is a sub concept of the StructureChange concept. It describes changes that simultaneously affect several TSNFeature by modifying their Geometry and sometime other attributs of the TSNFeatures. The set of TSNFeatures (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the GeometryRestructuration event is determined following the rule described by (Plumejeaud C, Mathian H, Gensel J, Grasland C. Spatio-temporal analysis of territorial changes from a multi-scale perspective. International Journal of Geographical Information Science. 25, 1597–1612 (2011)):\"For any event type, a geometrical invariant defines the set of units involved in the one event: the combination of unit footprints that existed prior the event (preceding ones) is equal to the combination of unit footprints that are still in existence after the event (succeeding ones).\". Except in case of GeometryRestructuration caused by a TerritoryChange that affect the external boundaries of the TerritoryVersion observed. Then, in this case, the set of TSNFeature (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the StructureChange event is determined following the rule: changes are grouped together if they occur simultaneously, inside a area which extends from the new territory boundaries to unit(s) boundaries that match the ones of unit(s) before the event. This concept is equivalent to the \"evolution of spatial structure\" notion from (Claramunt C, Thériault M. Managing Time in GIS An Event-Oriented Approach. In: Clifford J, Tuzhilin A, editors. Recent Advances in Temporal Databases. London: Springer London; 1995. p. 23–42. Available from: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4471-3033-8_2)."@en <http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#> .

<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/SOU_NATURAL_UNITS> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "<p>In physics, natural units are physical units of measurement based only on universal physical constants. For example the elementary charge e is a natural unit of electric charge, or the speed of light c is a natural unit of speed.</p>\r\n<p>A purely natural system of units is defined in such a way that some set of selected universal physical constants are normalized to unity; that is, their numerical values in terms of these units become exactly 1.</p>\r\n<p>Examples are Planck Units and Atomic Units. Atomic units (au or a.u.) form a system of natural units which is especially convenient for atomic physics calculations. There are two different kinds of atomic units, which one might name Hartree atomic units and Rydberg atomic units, which differ in the choice of the unit of mass and charge.</p>\r\n<p>Planck units are unique among systems of natural units, because they are not defined in terms of properties of any prototype, physical object, or even elementary particle.</p>"^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
