The preferred domain of this property is #Performance, so as to model that \"a concert presents a performance (of a musical work) that is realized by this performer\". However, in natural language, we often say that \"a concert has performers who play these musical works\", i.e. the domain of 'performer' is #Musical_Event in this case, and it would be more intuitive model. Hence, the domain is leave unrestricted here for a moment. " <http://www.kanzaki.com/ns/music> .
