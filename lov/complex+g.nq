If more than one geometry description should be added to an object, the relation omg:hasGeometry to a new individual of the type omg:Geometry should be used for each geometry description. This step is necessary to allow interconnections between the geometry descriptions regarding their derivation or complementation for easier upkeep of data integrity. The introduction of subproperties of this property for specific geometry descriptions (e.g. OntoBREP, GEOM, OntoSTEP) may ease querying for wanted geometry description formats."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
