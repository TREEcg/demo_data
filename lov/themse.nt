A data sheet might describe for example the accuracy in various conditions, the power use, the types of connectors that the sensor has, etc.  \n\nGenerally a sensor's properties are recorded directly (with hasMeasurementCapability, for example), but the data sheet can be used for example to record the manufacturers specifications verses observed capabilites, or if more is known than the manufacturer specifies, etc.  The data sheet is an information object about the sensor's properties, rather than a direct link to the actual properties themselves." <https://www.w3.org/ns/ssn> .
