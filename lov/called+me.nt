<http://theme-e.adaptcentre.ie/dave#Metric> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This is the smallest unit of characterisation of data value. It is part of a larger group called Metric Group (See dave:MetricGroup). This concept represents metrics that are heuristics designed to fit a specific assessment situation. Metrics are provided as subclasses of this abstract class, which is not intended for direct usage."@en <http://theme-e.adaptcentre.ie/dave/dave.ttl> .

<http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/resource/om-2/Unit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A unit of measure is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law. It is used as a standard for measurement of the same quantity, where any other value of the quantity can be expressed as a simple multiple of the unit. For example, length is a quantity; the metre is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10 metre (or 10 m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called \"metre\"."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .
