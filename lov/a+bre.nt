A single event may be described by several programmes, for example one may give a break down by day, another by rooms, another by topic.\n\nA programme should not have Timeslots or Events if it subprogrammes. In effect this means there are two subclasses of Programme, but there's no need to express that in the data.\n\nA simple application only needs to operate on a single Programme at once." <http://purl.org/prog/> .

<http://schema.org/BreadcrumbList> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A BreadcrumbList is an ItemList consisting of a chain of linked Web pages, typically described using at least their URL and their name, and typically ending with the current page.<br/><br/>\n\nThe <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/position\">position</a> property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in a BreadcrumbList The convention is that a breadcrumb list has an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/itemListOrder\">itemListOrder</a> of <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/ItemListOrderAscending\">ItemListOrderAscending</a> (lower values listed first), and that the first items in this list correspond to the \"top\" or beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage. The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' for the first item in the list." <http://schema.org/> .
