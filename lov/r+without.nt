We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.\n\nWe model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThe CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.\n\nExamples:\n- the Cullinan Diamond (E19)\n- the cave \"Ideon Andron\" in Crete (E26)\n- the Mona Lisa (E22)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE18(x) ⊃ E72(x)\nE18(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E4_Period> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\n\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\n\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nAs the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\n\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\n\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.\n\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\nJurassic\nEuropean Bronze Age\nItalian Renaissance\nThirty Years War\nSturm und Drang\nCubism\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE4(x) ⊃ E2(x)\nE4(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<https://data.nasa.gov/ontologies/atmonto/ATM#NRSfix> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The NRS is a system of waypoints developed for use within the United States for flight planning and navigation without reference to ground based navigational aids. The NRS waypoints are located in a grid pattern along defined latitude and longitude lines. NRS waypoint names are composed of two letters followed by two numbers, followed by a single letter. The first and second characters of NRS waypoints are the FIR identifier for the United States (“K”) and the FIR subdivision, or ARTCC center in which the waypoint is located (e.g. “D” for Denver ARTCC). The third and fourth characters are a number group representing the latitude of the waypoint. These numbers begin at the equator with 00 and advances north and south from 01 to 90 and correspond to every 10 minutes of latitude and repeating every 15°. The final character in the NRS waypoint is a letter representing the line of longitude for which the waypoint is located. This identifier starts at the prime meridian moving west to east and uses the letters A to Z while repeating every 26°. To date, the current density of the NRS grid is one waypoint spaced every 30 minutes of latitude and every 2° of longitude." <https://data.nasa.gov/ontologies/atmonto/ATM#> .
