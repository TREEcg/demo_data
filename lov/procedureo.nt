The process has the role procedure with respect to the observation. A process might be responsible for more than one generatedObservation.\r\n\r\nThe OM_Process shall be suitable for the observed property. As a corollary, details of the observed property are constrained by the procedure used.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE Observed radiance wavelength is determined by the response characteristics of the sensor.\r\n\r\nA description of the observation procedure provides or implies an indication of the reliability or quality of the observation result." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite> .
