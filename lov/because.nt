Formally, an\n            action is an Process which is constrained to be contained (isMemberOf) some Unit. In\n            Drammar, an Action can be part of a plan of an agent (formally, a plan ia a list of\n            actions), or can be included in a Unit (ordered into some timeline).

In Drammar there is no distinction\n            between knowing and believing, because reasoning concerns the agent motivations for\n            acting, rather than the relationship between single agent knowledge and shared\n            knowledge. A belief is formally defined as the type of MentalState described by a\n            BeliefSchema. In the annotation, it is in the scope a ConsistenStateSet, that is\n            precondition or effect of a Plan.

Emotion 2. Belief 3. Goal 4. Value Belief and\n            Goal are traditionally described as having a propositional content because they both\n            concern some attitude of the agent toward a proposition; in Drammar, we don't\n            enforce this distinction because the reference theoriesd we adopt for emotion and values\n            also enforce some time of propositional content. The only difference is that only the\n            schema types for beliefs and goals (BeliefSchema and GoalSchema) have a propositional\n            content attached to it (through the propositionalContent object property). A MentalState\n            is defined as an EventiveState that is described by a MentalStateSchema. The latter are\n            to be specified as EmotionSchema, BeliefSchema, GoalSchema, ValueSchema,\n            depending on the MentalState type: so, the MentalStateSchema type works as a selector\n            for the right trait of the mental schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has \"twice the length\" of another (= is \"twice as long\"). Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying \"how much\" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or \"how many\" (a count). The Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
