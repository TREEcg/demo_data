However, it is possible to stick to FRBR and bypass the worflow\nmechanism this ontology defines by using the core FRBR properties on such objects. But it is often better to use events to interconnect such \nexpressions (allowing to go deeply into the production process - `this performer was playing this particular instrument at that\nparticular time').\n    \n    " <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .
