<http://www.purl.org/drammar#ConsistentStateSet> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A ConsistentStateSet is a set of states held consistent by definition. It can\n            be a set of states bordering a timeline (i.e., the state of affairs holding before and\n            after the timeline) or it can be the state of affairs that holds before and after a plan\n            (in this case, it represents the plan precondintions and effects). The\n            isTimelinePreconditionOf (isTimelineEffectOf) property connects a ConsistentStateSet\n            with a Timeline. The isPlanPreconditionOf (isPlanEffectOf) property connects a\n            ConsistentStateSet with a Plan. A ConsistentStateSet has one or more states as its\n            members (hasMember property)" <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
