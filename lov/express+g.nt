Morphemes are commonly classified into free forms (morphemes which can occur as separate words) adn bound forms (morphemes which cannot so occur - mainly affixes).  A further distinction may be made between lexical and grammatical morphemes; the former are morphemes used for the construction of new words in a language; the latter are morphemes used to express grammatical relationships between a word and its context.

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/LocativeCase> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "(adj./n.) In languages which express grammatical relationships by means of inflections, this term refers to the form taken by a noun phrase (often a single noun or pronoun), when it typically expresses the idea of location of an entity or action. Structures which express locational meaning may also be referred to as locative, e.g. in 'The woman was standing at a bus stop', 'at a bus stop' could be called a locative phrase.
