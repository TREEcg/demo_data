Using this extension, it becomes possible to describe a context for construction-related datasets that are being distributed using Web technology as well as datasets that are not shared outside an organization such as local copies, work in progress and other datasets that remain internal. This dataset metadata encompasses the temporal context (period or snapshot), the type of content of the dataset (as-built, design, etc.) and relations between contextualized datasets (previous as-built, requirements related to a design, etc.).

Using this extension, it becomes possible to describe a context for construction-related datasets that are being distributed using Web technology as well as datasets that are not shared outside an organization such as local copies, work in progress and other datasets that remain internal. This dataset metadata encompasses the temporal context (period or snapshot), the type of content of the dataset (as-built, design, etc.) and relations between contextualized datasets (previous as-built, requirements related to a design, etc.). In addition, this DCAT extension also provides terminology for managing dataset distributions that are scoped to a certain (named or default) graph of an RDF file or quadstore."@en <https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov> .
