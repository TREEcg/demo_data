A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\n\nAny object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring\n- the place referred to in the phrase: \"Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone\"\n- here -> <-\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE53(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/muo#SimpleDerivedUnit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Units that are derived from exactly one base unit. There are two main possibilities. On one hand, there are units that are derived by adding a prefix to the unit. The prefix is a name or associated symbol (e.g. kilo) that precedes a unit of measure (e.g. meter) to form a decimal multiple or submultiple (e.g. Kilometer). Derived units, obtained by the application of a prefix, measure the same physical quality as its base unit. On the other hand, there are another kind of simple derived units that are also obtained from exactly one base unit but they measure a different physical quality. They are obtained by changing the exponent of the unit in the dimensional equation. For instance, this is how square meters are derived from meters. This exponent is represented in MUO with the datatype property muo:dimensionalSize. Combining this two patterns we can represent units that are obtained from a prefix and that have a dimension size different from 1, for instance, the unit square kilometer."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .
