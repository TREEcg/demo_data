<https://w3id.org/cdc#StandaloneDistribution> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A cdc:StandaloneDistribution is applied to classify a distribution as being standalone, meaning that it does not complement to the content of another dataset. Consequently, the content served by this distribution is equal to the entire content represented by its dataset. If a standalone distribution is derived from a complementing distribution of the same dataset, it can be connected using the cdc:standaloneOf relation."@en <https://w3id.org/cdc> .
