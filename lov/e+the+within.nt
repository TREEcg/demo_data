<http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot#> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "Many testbeds owning devices or applications interacting with the sensors, store their inherent observations and other related data in their own proprietary format. In other words, making a testbed independent and isolated from others that cannot directly interact with each other. Differences in the data format lead to interoperability issues between the testbeds and much work has to be done in order to ensure the compatibility. One has to understand different data formats and create the mapping between them. As a result, a testbed must understand other testbed's format and create the mapping both while sending and receiving information. One method to accomplish  interoperability is through the usage of semantic-based technologies to annotate all the information shared by the platforms. Nevertheless, some of the relevant existing ontologies promise interoperability but: \n\n- do not address the problem to describe the observation in an interoperable manner to ease further tasks, such as reasoning, \n- many of them are domain-specific and cannot be applied across domains, \n- they have missing concepts and do not suffice the needs of the measurements provided by the sensors, and \n- many ontologies do not follow best practices making it hard to correctly interpret and reuse concepts.\n\n\nIn order to address the above-mentioned limitations, we provide FIESTA-IoT ontology (a unified semantic model) that follows best practices. FIESTA-IoT Ontology is a merge of concepts from various ontologies such as IoT-lite, M3-lite Taxonomy, SSN, Time and DUL (see Figure 1). The FIESTA-IoT Ontology is diveded into 2 parts: resourse description and observations produced. One has to follow the Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively, for understanding what all concepts are associated with resourse description and observation. Using such information testbeds can annotate their data to FIESTA-IoT specific requirements and the annotators developed can achieve FIESTA-IoT certification.\n\n\nFor more detials please see:\n\n- R.

<http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot#> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "After a thorough analysis of existing Internet of Things (IoT) related ontologies, we propose FIESTA-IoT Ontology that aims to achieve semantic interoperability among heterogeneous testbeds. The Ontology is framed within the EU H2020's FIESTA-IoT project, that aims to seamlessly support the federation of testbeds through the usage of semantic-based technologies. The  FIESTA-IoT ontology takes inspiration from the well-known Noy et al. methodology  for reusing and interconnecting existing ontologies. To build the ontology, we leverage a number of core concepts from various mainstream ontologies and taxonomies, such as Semantic Sensor Network (SSN), M3-lite (a lite version of M3 ontology), WGS84, IoT-lite, Time, and DUL ontology.

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DescriptionTemplate> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DescriptionTemplate This class contains a well known role-based pattern for\n            representing the linguistic schemata that describe the elements of drama, such as the\n            entities and dynamics. Drammar imports this pattern from other ontologies, namely DOLCE.\n            The class DescriptionTemplate contains two classes: - Role - SituationSchema The class\n            SituationSchema provides the specific pattern for the description of incidents and\n            states, generically termed here as \"situations\". A situation can be either a\n            process or a state, usually described by a linguistic expression consisting of a verb\n            (\"giving\") for processes, such as in the expression \"Ophelia gives the\n            gift back to Hamlet\", or a by a preposition (\"behind\") for states, such\n            as in the expression \"Polonius is behind the tapestry\"). The Role class\n            provides the pattern for the roles that play a part in the state or process (in the\n            above example, the role of the \"donor\" filled by Ophelia, the role of the\n            \"recipient\" filled by Hamlet, etc.). The linguistic counterpart of the\n            role-based structure of the description templates is provided by a frame-like accounts\n            of the linguistic descriptions of events, such as Framenet or Verbnet\n            (https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml). Based on a lexical\n            semantics perspective, these initiatives are aimed at grouping verbs (including\n            statives) into \"frames of action\", i.e., linguistic structures representing a\n            group of semantically similar verbs with the complements that accompany them. Following\n            a design choice that characterizes the Drammar ontology, all references to the external\n            (linguistic or commonsense) knowledge are mediated by the ExternalReference class, a top\n            level class whose function is specifically to act as a bridge to the external knowledge\n            (see the documentation of the class). So, neither the Roles nor the Situation Schemata\n            directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge they assume: rather, the hasExtRef\n            property links each component of the pattern onto its corresponding class within the\n            ExternalReference class: the SituationSchema class is related to the ExternalRefSchema,\n            the Role class is related to the ExternalRefRole class. Each ExternalReference subclass,\n            then, bridges each pattern component onto the corresponding component within the\n            external knowledge source via a specific data type property." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
