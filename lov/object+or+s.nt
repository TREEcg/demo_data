It can also refer to a skos:Concept node that represents a node in a SKOS taxonomy; this node and all its descendants (skos:narrower or inverse skos:broader) can be used as an object of the property (instance or type property). In the case of properties level 2 or 3, this property refers to the range or object for the generic schema:value property of the entire property pattern."@en <https://w3id.org/con-tax> .

<https://w3id.org/cto#RepairTask> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A specialized type of a (planned or executed) construction task that repairs a damaged construction element or spatial zone. The subjects of this type of task are construction damages. Depending on the degree of modeling, a repair task can either directly result in the lifting of a damage (and its influence on properties of the damaged object) or subtasks can be defined e.g. to remove a damaged construction component and replace it by a new one."@en <https://w3id.org/cto> .
