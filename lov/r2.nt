<http://inference-web.org/2.0/pml-provenance.owl#InferenceRule> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Inference rules are used to derive conclusions from premises.\nInference Web divides inference rules into three classes: Primitive and Derived and Translation. \nThis is an abstract class without any direct instance. A primitive rule is an atomic rule with respect to an inference engine. An inference engine may support rules that it does not need to further decompose. Since a primitive rule is an inference engine dependent concept, we may find a rule is primitive to one inference engine but not to another engine. For example a `natural deduction reasoner R1 may define Modus Ponens as a primitive rule and another reasoner R2 may register Robinson's resolution rule as a primitive rule. The reasoner R2 may be able to derive a Modus Ponens rule using its primitive resolution rule. "@en <http://inference-web.org/2.0/pml-provenance.owl> .
