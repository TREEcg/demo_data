The Service exposes the Functionality to the network and makes it discoverable, registerable and remotely controllable in the network. \nA Service is offered by a device that wants (a certain set of) its Functionalities to be discoverable, registerable, remotely controllable by other devices in the network. \nA Service can expose one or more Functionalities and a Functionality can be exposed by one or more Services.\nThe Input- and Output DataPoints and Operations of a Service may have the same names as for a different Service, however the Service to which they belong differentiates how they are addressed in the Device (e.g. via a port specific to the Service).\nNOTE: While a Functionality  describes the – human understandable – meaning of a Service of the device the Service is used to describe how such functionality is represented in a communication network and can be accessed by electronic means. The Service and its Operations is therefore dependent on the technology of the network, hard- and software of the device." <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .

<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/RatioScale> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has \"twice the length\" of another (= is \"twice as long\"). Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying \"how much\" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or \"how many\" (a count). The Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .

It is designed to yield high modeling power and elasticity to cope with the huge variety in funding and project practices, which makes it applicable to many areas where funding is an important aspect: first of all research, but also the arts, cultural conservation, and many others." <https://w3id.org/dingo/> .
