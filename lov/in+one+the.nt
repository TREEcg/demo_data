<http://www.onem2m.org/ontology/Base_Ontology/base_ontology#Thing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Thing in oneM2M  (Class: Thing) is an entity that can be identified in the oneM2M System. \nA Thing that is not a Device is not able to conmmunicate electronically with its environment. However, the sub-class of Thing that is able to interact electronically is called a \"Device\".\nA Thing may have ThingProperties (Object Property: hasThingProperty). A Thing can have relations to other things (Object Property: hasThingRelation).\nSince a Thing that is not a Device is not able to conmmunicate electronically it cannot influence the value of its ThingProperties or being influenced by it. Similarly a Thing cannot document its - real-world - relationships (via hasThingRelation) to other Things.\n\nE.g. A room that is modelled in oneM2M would be a Thing that could have a room-temperature as a ThingProperty and could have a relationship \"isAdjacentTo\" to another room" <http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot> .

<http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#GeometryRestructuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The GeometryRestructuration concept is a sub concept of the StructureChange concept. It describes changes that simultaneously affect several TSNFeature by modifying their Geometry and sometime other attributs of the TSNFeatures. The set of TSNFeatures (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the GeometryRestructuration event is determined following the rule described by (Plumejeaud C, Mathian H, Gensel J, Grasland C. Spatio-temporal analysis of territorial changes from a multi-scale perspective. International Journal of Geographical Information Science. 25, 1597–1612 (2011)):\"For any event type, a geometrical invariant defines the set of units involved in the one event: the combination of unit footprints that existed prior the event (preceding ones) is equal to the combination of unit footprints that are still in existence after the event (succeeding ones).\". Except in case of GeometryRestructuration caused by a TerritoryChange that affect the external boundaries of the TerritoryVersion observed. Then, in this case, the set of TSNFeature (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the StructureChange event is determined following the rule: changes are grouped together if they occur simultaneously, inside a area which extends from the new territory boundaries to unit(s) boundaries that match the ones of unit(s) before the event. This concept is equivalent to the \"evolution of spatial structure\" notion from (Claramunt C, Thériault M. Managing Time in GIS An Event-Oriented Approach. In: Clifford J, Tuzhilin A, editors. Recent Advances in Temporal Databases. London: Springer London; 1995. p. 23–42. Available from: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4471-3033-8_2)."@en <http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#> .
