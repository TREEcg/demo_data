<https://w3id.org/omg#GeometryState> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A geometry state is an evaluation holding the geometry description and metadata about a geometry that was true for the given time. \nIn case of geometry states, changing geometric properties does not cause the need for a new geometry state as long as the property was changed using the OPM concepts. If this is not the case, a copy of the now valid graph must be created and attached to a new geometry state. If an object within the geometry graph is changed (e.g. changing the primitive \"Box\" into a primitive \"Sphere\"), the old primitive (\"Box\") should be classified as opm:Deleted and the new primitive (\"Sphere\") should be added to the geometry graph in the correct place. The new geometry state should then be connected to any object of the geometry graph that is not opm:Deleted using the omg:containsGeometryObject relation.\nMetadata of a geometry state must as a minimum be the time of generation stated by prov:generatedAtTime, but preferably also a prov:wasAttributedTo reference to the agent who created the state. In case properties are changed using the OPM concepts, the most current time of generation and agent who created the state will be determined using the omg:containsPropertyState relation.\nDerived geometry descriptions are also stored as states as these change when the base geometry changes."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
