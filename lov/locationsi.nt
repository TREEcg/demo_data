P7took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (generally on the surface of the earth).  For example, the period \"Révolution française\" can be said to have taken place in \"France\", the \"Victorian\" period, may be said to have taken place in \"Britain\" and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and north America.\nA period can take place at multiple locations.\nIt is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within (contains) to E53 Place. Describe in words.\n\nExamples \n- the period \"Révolution française\" (E4) took place at France (E53)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP7(x,y) ⊃ E4(x)\nP7(x,y) ⊃ E53(y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
