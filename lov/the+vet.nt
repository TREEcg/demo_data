<http://vocab.data.gov/def/fea#Customer> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The diverse nature of federal programs means that there are many customers spanning the citizen, business, other government, and internal categories.  Some customers\nreceive direct government services, such as veterans receiving health care from the Veterans Health Administration. Other â€œcustomersâ€ are those subject to regulatory activities, such as large businesses conforming to safety regulations administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Importantly, the citizen is generally considered to be the ultimate â€œcustomerâ€ of government activities regardless of the nature of the customer relationship.\nPRM volume 1, p.14" <http://vocab.data.gov/def/fea> .
