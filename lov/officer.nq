<http://www.w3.org/ns/person#Person> <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#definition> "An officer is a natural person (as opposed to a legal person) [person:] that has a high-level management role in a Company (e.g., the CEO, treasurer and chief financial officer). Despite their high status, they typically serve at the will of the corporate directors, who can fire or replace them. Officers can also be shareholders and directors but don't necessarily have to be. They have the authority to act on behalf of the corporation, including contract authority." <http://data.businessgraph.io/ontology#> .
