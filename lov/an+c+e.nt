<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#TransportWithBiochemicalReaction> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: A conversion interaction that is both a biochemicalReaction and a transport. In transportWithBiochemicalReaction interactions, one or more of the substrates changes both their location and their physical structure. Active transport reactions that use ATP as an energy source fall under this category, even if the only covalent change is the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.\n\nRationale: This class was added to support a large number of transport events in pathway databases that have a biochemical reaction during the transport process. It is not expected that other double inheritance subclasses will be added to the ontology at the same level as this class.\n\nExamples: In the PEP-dependent phosphotransferase system, transportation of sugar into an E. coli cell is accompanied by the sugar's phosphorylation as it crosses the plasma membrane." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
