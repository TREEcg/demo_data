For example, a song is considered fixed when it is written down on paper. The paper is the medium on which the song can be perceived, reproduced and communicated. \nIt is not necessary that the medium be such that a human can perceive the work, as long as the work can be perceived by a machine. Thus, the song is also fixed the moment the author records it onto a cassette tape. Similarly, a computer program is fixed when stored on a computer hard drive.\nFrom the legal point of view, the fixations that are governed are those that store performances of works. The more important kinds of fixations are sound recordings and motion pictures. \nThe theme of a Record is a Performance but it is not necessarily a public performance. For instance, it can be a studio performance, which is governed by copyright because this fixation is intended for commercial exploitation."@en <http://rhizomik.net/ontologies/copyrightonto.owl> .

We define observation in the sense of natural sciences, as a kind of human activity: at some Place and within some Time-Span, certain Physical Things and their behavior and interactions are observed, either directly by human sensory impression, or enhanced with tools and measurement devices. The output of the internal processes of measurement devices that do not require additional human interaction are in general regarded as part of the observation and not as additional inference. Manual recordings may serve as additional evidence. Measurements and witnessing of events are special cases of observations. Observations result in a belief about certain propositions. In this model, the degree of confidence in the observed properties is regarded to be “true” per default, but could be described differently by adding a property LC7 is about  to an instance of BC45  Observation, or by reification of the property O16 observed value. Primary data from measurement devices are regarded in this model to be results of observation and can be interpreted as propositions believed to be true within the (known) tolerances and degree of reliability of the device. Observations represent the transition between reality and propositions in the form of instances of a formal ontology, and can be subject to data evaluation from this point on."@en <http://www.ics.forth.gr/isl/MarineTLO/v4/marinetlo.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#expresses> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This is a large comment field for those who want to investigate the different uses of the 'expresses' relation for modeling different approaches to meaning characterization and modeling.\nFor example, in all these cases, some aspect of meaning is involved:\n\n- Beehive means \"a structure in which bees are kept, typically in the form of a dome or box.\" (Oxford dictionary)\n- 'Beehive' is a synonym in noun synset 09218159 \"beehive|hive\" (WordNet)\n- 'the term Beehive can be interpreted as the fact of 'being a beehive', i.e. a relation that holds for concepts such as Bee, Honey, Hosting, etc.'\n- 'the text of Italian apiculture regulation expresses a rule by which beehives should be kept at least one kilometer away from inhabited areas'\n- 'the term Beehive expresses the concept Beehive'\n- ''Beehive' for apiculturists does not express the same meaning as for, say, fishermen'\n- 'Your meaning of 'Beautiful' does not seem to fit mine'\n- ''Beehive' is formally interpreted as the set of all beehives'\n- 'from the term 'Beehive', we can build a vector space of statistically significant cooccurring terms in the documents that contain it'\n- the lexeme 'Belly' expresses the role 'Body_Part' in the frame 'ObservableBodyParts' (FrameNet)\n\nAs the examples suggest, the 'meaning of meaning' is dependent on the background approach/theory that one assumes. One can hardly make a summary of the too many approaches and theories of meaning, therefore this relation is maybe the most controversial and difficult to explain; normally, in such cases it would be better to give up formalizing. \nHowever, the usefulness of having a 'semantic abstraction' in modeling information objects is so high (e.g. for the semantic web, interoperability, reengineering, etc.), that we accept this challenging task, although without taking any particular position in the debate. \nWe provide here some examples, which we want to generalize upon when using the 'expresses' relation to model semantic aspects of social reality.\n\nIn the most common approach, lexicographers that write dictionaries, glossaries, etc. assume that the meaning of a term is a paraphrase (or 'gloss', or 'definition'). \nAnother approach is provided by concept schemes like thesauri and lexicons, which assume that the meaning of a term is a 'concept', encoded as a 'lemma', 'synset', or 'descriptor'.\nStill another approach is that of psychologists and cognitive scientists, which often assume that the meaning of an information object is a concept encoded in the mind or cognitive system of an agent. \nA radically different approach is taken by social scientists and semioticians, who usually assume that meanings of an information object are spread across the communication practices in which members of a community use that object.\nAnother approach that tackles the distributed nature of meaning is assumed by geometrical models of semantics, which assume that the meaning of an InformationObject (e.g. a word) results from the set of informational contexts (e.g. within texts) in which that object is used similarly.\nThe logical approach to meaning is still different, since it assumes that the meaning of e.g. a term is equivalent to the set of individuals that the term can be applied to; for example, the meaning of 'Ali' is e.g. an individual person called Ali, the meaning of 'Airplane' is e.g. the set of airplanes, etc. \nFinally, an approach taken by structuralist linguistics and frame semantics is that a meaning is the relational context in which an information object can be applied; for example, a meaning of 'Airplane' is situated e.g. in the context ('frame') of passenger airline flights.\n\nThese different approaches are not necessarily conflicting, and they mostly talk about different aspects of so-called 'semantics'. They can be summarized and modelled within DOLCE-Ultralite as follows (notice that such list is far from exhaustive):\n\n(1) Informal meaning (as for linguistic or commonsense semantics: a distinction is assumed between (informal) meaning and reference; see isAbout for an alternative pattern on reference)\n\t- Paraphrase meaning (as for lexicographic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and different instances of InformationObject that act as 'paraphrases'\n\t- Conceptual meaning (as for 'concept scheme' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Concept\n\t- Relational meaning (as for frame semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of Description\n\t- Cognitive meaning (as for 'psychological' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isRealizedBy a mental, cognitive or neural state (depending on which theory of mind is assumed). Such states can be considered here as instances of Process (occurring in the mind, cognitive system, or neural system of an agent)\n\t- Cultural meaning (as for 'social science' semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between instances of InformationObject and instances of SocialObject (institutions, cultural paradigms, norms, social practices, etc.)\n\t- Distributional meaning (as for geometrical models of meaning). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between any instance of InformationObject and any different instance of InformationObject that isFormallyRepresentedIn some (geometrical) Region (e.g. a vector space)\n\n(2) Formal meaning (as for logic and formal semantics: no distinction is assumed between informal meaning and reference, therefore between 'expresses' and 'isAbout', which can be used interchangeably)\n\t- Object-level formal meaning (as in the traditional first-order logic semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor (in most cases) a Set; isGroundingFor is defined in the ontology: http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl\n\t- Modal formal meaning (as in possible-world semantics). Here it is modelled as the expresses relation between an instance of InformationObject and an instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a Set, and which isPartOf some different instance of Collection that isGroundingFor a PossibleWorld\n\nThis is only a first step to provide a framework, in which one can model different aspects of meaning. A more developed ontology should approach the problem of integrating the different uses of 'expresses', so that different theories, resources, methods can interoperate." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names. \n\nThe criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.\nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci\n- Stonehenge\n- the hole in the ozone layer\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics\n- the Bermuda Triangle\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE77(x) ⊃ E1(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

This allows you to describe the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26 Feature IsA E53 Place) may be a practical approach.\n\nFor instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.\n\nThis property is a subproperty of P161 has spatial projection because it refers to its own domain as reference space for its range, whereas P161 has spatial projection may refer to a place in terms of any reference space.

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0100062> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "1. The term 'line' is used when a culture has undergone an intentional experimental process to establish a more uniform and stable population of cells (see 'establishing cell line'). This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, 'lines' are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time. A *new* cell line can be \"established\" not only through the passaging/selection of a primary culture, but also through experimental modifications of existing lines (e.g. immortalization, stable genetic modifications, drug selection for a resistant subset, etc.).  As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quescent state for future use. \n\n2. The definitional criteria provided here for the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.?\n\n3. Definitinal criteria are intended to be sufficiently clear to specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world. A 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this common history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to the collection of all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as cells in these collections will likely not all share a common culture history. Rather, 'HeLa cell line' could refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).  As noted above, it is such collections that are typically referred to in scientific discourse and publications.\n\n4. Notably, the term 'line' has been alternately used by other terminologies and communities to refer to cultures that have been immortalized - ie has attained the capacity for indefinite propagation in vitro.  In this ontology, we refer to such cell lines as 'immortal cell lines', and use the term 'cell line' to indicate any culture that has been passaged." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Subclass axioms were: 'has grain' some 'cell line cell' and 'has grain' only 'cell line cell'\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: There is considerable ambiguity and inconsistent usage surrounding the term 'cell line' across biomedical communities. For exmaple, it can refer to the maximal collection of all cells in a cultured lineage (e.g. the colelction of all HeLa cells that exist), or to discrete portions of this maximal collection that are stored, exchanged, and applied experimentally (e.g. the dish of HeLa cells I am using in my experiment). A working group of representatives from OBI, CLO, and CL was assembled in spring of 2013 to harmonize modeling and terminology surrounding experimentally cultured cells across Open Biomedical Ontologies, following OBO Foundry principles of orthogonality and re-use. A consensus was reached to apply the term 'cell line' to refer not to a maximal collection of cells of a given type, but to discrete populations of cultured cells that share a common propagation history which has conferred a certain a genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to the population.  This meaning reflects its most common usage in domain discourse, and will best support data annotation requirements. This view means that a 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this specific history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to collections such as all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as all cells in these collections do not necessarily share a common culture history. Rather, it could be used to refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).\n\nThis approach seems to accomplish several desirable goals:\n1) It allows us to define the term 'cell line' for the community in a precise way that also reflects how the term is most commonly used in the literature and scientific discourse.\n(2) It gives a definition that provides clear criteria to help specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world\n(3) The criteria it provides demarcate populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.\n(4) The definition seems to be true to the meaning of the word 'line' - which is suggests a specific lineage of derivation." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .
