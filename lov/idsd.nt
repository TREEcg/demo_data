<https://w3id.org/idsa/core/DatRequestPayload> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Dynamic Attribute Token (DAT) *Request* Payload is the JSON Element of any DAT containing the claims of the token bearer. This payload itself is a JSON-LD encoded RDF class with a defined set of attributes. These attributes are either defined by RFC 7519 or by the IDS Information Model. As a direct consequence of regarding the DAT Payload as JSON-LD, *all* DAT Payloads must have exactly one \"@context\" attribute with the IDS context URI as its value and a \"@type\" with ids:DatPayload as its value. Note that, different to the DatPayload, the DatRequestPayload contains the *self-claims* of a connector and is not yet signed by any DAPS. Consequently, no other connector must accept a DatRequest object as a DAT. A DatRequest and its contained DatRequestPayload is *only* intended for interactions with a DAPS and *nothing else*!"@en <https://w3id.org/idsa/core> .
