<http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop#hasDate> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Typically, Date will be associated with the creation or availability of the resource. Recommended best practice for encoding the date value is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 [W3CDTF] and includes (among others) dates of the form YYYY-MM-DD. For official documents, it could be the date of signature. It can also contain a java timestamp. Usually, time is connected to a happening (event/situation) in which the information resource is a participation entity. These include: creation of the information resource, its modification or other important happening. Very often such happening is in the background knowledge and the modeling of domain task does not require the explicit representation of this happening. If it plays important role in the model domain or for the task, then the user needs to extend the ontology in an appropriate way."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .

In some cases, particularly in archaeology and the life sciences, E83 Type Creation requires the identification of an exemplary specimen and the publication of the type definition in an appropriate scholarly forum. The activity of E83 Type Creation is central to research in the life sciences, where a type would be referred to as a \"taxon,\" the type description as a \"protologue,\" and the exemplary specimens as \"orgininal element\" or \"holotype\".\n\nExamples:\n- creation of the taxon 'Penicillium brefeldianum B. O. Dodge' (1933)\n- addition of class E84 Information Carrier to the CIDOC CRM\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE83(x) ⊃ E65(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The physical characteristics of the features themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.\n\nEXAMPLE A “station” is essentially an identifiable locality where a sensor system or procedure may be deployed and an observation made. In the context of the observation model, it connotes the “world in the vicinity of the station”, so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artefact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc.\n\nNOTE A transient sampling feature, such as a ships-track or flight-line, might be identified and described, but is unlikely to be revisited exactly.\n\nA sampling feature is intended to sample some feature-of-interest in an application domain, so there is an expectation of at least one sampledFeature property. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/sam-lite> .
