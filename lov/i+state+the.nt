<https://w3id.org/omg#GeometryState> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A geometry state is an evaluation holding the geometry description and metadata about a geometry that was true for the given time. \nIn case of geometry states, changing geometric properties does not cause the need for a new geometry state as long as the property was changed using the OPM concepts. If this is not the case, a copy of the now valid graph must be created and attached to a new geometry state. If an object within the geometry graph is changed (e.g. changing the primitive \"Box\" into a primitive \"Sphere\"), the old primitive (\"Box\") should be classified as opm:Deleted and the new primitive (\"Sphere\") should be added to the geometry graph in the correct place. The new geometry state should then be connected to any object of the geometry graph that is not opm:Deleted using the omg:containsGeometryObject relation.\nMetadata of a geometry state must as a minimum be the time of generation stated by prov:generatedAtTime, but preferably also a prov:wasAttributedTo reference to the agent who created the state. In case properties are changed using the OPM concepts, the most current time of generation and agent who created the state will be determined using the omg:containsPropertyState relation.\nDerived geometry descriptions are also stored as states as these change when the base geometry changes."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#SituationSchema> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The situation schema provides the pattern for the description of incidents and states. It is inspired by the Situation ontology Pattern of the Ontology Design Pattern initiative (http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/). So, a SituationSchema describes (\"describes\" object property) a DramaPerdurant (either a State or a Process).\nThe schema works as a hub for the roles involved in a situation. The property hasRole links the Situation class (its domain) with the Role class (the range of the property). Also, notice that, as illustrated in the documentation of the SituationSchema class, a Situation Schema (or, better, its subclasses) does not directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge employed to describe drama: rather, it refers to the ExternalRefSchema class (subclass of the top level ExternalReference class), which in  turn refers to the linguistic knowledge. The SituationSchema class specializes into specific schemata for describing specific type of situations: \n- FrameNetSchema: for describing processes, like giving or killing (in Drammar, they are grouped into units arranged on timelines), and states, like being behind some object or being dead (in Drammar, they are bundled into sets that border timelines and plans). \n- MentalStateSchema: this class groups the specific types of schemata for describing the mental states of the agents in Drammar, namely beliefs, goals, emotions and values. \nTechnically, the subtypes of SituationSchema are characterized by different values of the quale_schemaType data property: \"belief\", \"emotion\", \"framenet\", \"goal\",  \"value\". \nFinally, it is worth mentioning that is a specific design choice of Drammar not to represent the nesting of states: only the type of the top level state, e.g., a belief, is represented, independent of what that belief contains in turn. This flat style of representation is determined by the decision not to commit to a specific logical account of state types. When Drammar is employed for annotation, the content nested into a state is described informally in natural language description accompanying the state, if needed. \nRefs: Gangemi, A., & Presutti, V.
