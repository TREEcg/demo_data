The p stands for progressive scan, i.e. non-interlaced. The 480 denotes a vertical resolution of 480 vertically scanning lines, usually with a horizontal resolution of 640 pixels and 4:3 aspect ratio or a horizontal resolution of 854 pixels and 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"480p\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/480p) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .

E.g. a point cloud of a columns laser scan in a high geometric detail complementing a simplified CSG geometry of the same column. Both geometry descriptions are closely related, but not directly derived from each other. The complementing geometry description may also just depict a small part of the entire geometry (e.g. the column header)."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
