<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Vowel> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "One of the two general categories used for the classification of speech sounds, the other being consonant. Phonetically, they are sounds articulated without a complete closure in the mouth that would produce a stop or a degree of narrowing that would create audible friction; the air escapes evenly over the center of the tongue. For oral vowels, air escapes solely through the mouth. If some air is simultaneously released through the nose, the vowel is nasal. The quality of the vowel sound is affected by the shape of the oral resonance chamber, chiefly influenced by the position of the lips and the position of the tongue.

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/LabialProperty> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Gestures involving the lips are said to be Labial. From the linguistic point of view the places of articulation can usefully be classified into a smaller number of groups based on the articulators they share. If consonants in which either the upper or lower lip is involved as an articulator are classified as Labials then there are three place classes among Labial sounds: the lower lip can articulate with the upper lip (bilabial), or the upper teeth (labiodentals)l and,  the upper lip can also be the target for the tongue (linguo-labial).

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/VelaricProperty> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Velaric refers to an air-stream mechanism wherein the air is generated by a closure at the velar position, rather than an air-stream generated by the lungs. The back of the tongue is raised against the velum, and articulations are made farther forward by the lips or front parts of the tongue, drawing air into or pushing air out of the mouth. The clicks of some African languages are produced in this way. In English, they may be heard in the 'tut tut' sound.

<http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Protruded> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An articulatory characteristic resulting from protrusion of the lips, often resulting in the appearance of a small labial cavity forward of the teeth and bounded at the front by the inside surfaces of the lips.  Often occurring with lip rounding, the protruded quality modifies the basic articulation by extending the length of the vocal tract and altering its cross-section, resulting in lowered frequencies on all formants.  Back rounded vowels are commonly more protruded than front rounded vowels. [Brosnahan and Malmberg 1976: 43, 67; Clark, Yallop and Fletcher 2007: 26, 64]"@eng <http://purl.org/linguistics/gold> .
