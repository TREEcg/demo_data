Such a construct is useful in different tourism domains, e.g. accommodation or gastronomy. Facilities may be associated with an accommodation, or with a single unit within an accommodation, or have some other, non-accommodation scope. This is reflected in the Extent property. Facilities may be available to all, or may be restricted to certain categories of user (e.g. golf course available only to penthouse guests). Lists of unit and accommodation facilities are provided in Appendix A." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .
