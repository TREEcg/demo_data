Ideally a more semantically meaningful predicate should be used, describing the capacity of something in a particular function.\n\nThis may be used to associate:\n\n    a classroom, theatre, cinema or resturant with the number of people it seats\n    a bar or other entertainment venue with the fire limit for the venue\n    a school with how many students it can teach\n    a pencil case with how many pencils it can hold. \n\nYou should be able to assume that resources of the same type, described in the same dataset, have capacities calculated in a more-or-less similar way.\n\nIt should only be treated as a rough guide." <http://purl.org/openorg/> .
