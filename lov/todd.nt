<http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Delegation> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#definition> "Delegation is the assignment of authority and responsibility to an agent (by itself or by another agent) to carry out a specific activity as a delegate or representative, while the agent it acts on behalf of retains some responsibility for the outcome of the delegated work.\n\nFor example, a student acted on behalf of his supervisor, who acted on behalf of the department chair, who acted on behalf of the university; all those agents are responsible in some way for the activity that took place but we do not say explicitly who bears responsibility and to what degree."@en <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .
