The identity of an instance of this class is determined by the identities of the constituing spacetime volume and the time-span. \n\nThis class can be used to define temporal snapshots at a particular time-span, such as the extent of the Roman Empire at 33 B.C., or the extent occupied by a museum object at rest in an exhibit. In particular, it can be used to define the spatial projection of a spacetime volume during a particular time-span, such as the maximal spatial extent of a flood at some particular hour, or all areas covered by the Poland within the 20th century AD.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE93(x) ⊃ E92(x)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

Moves may also be documented to consist of other moves (via P9 consists of (forms part of)), in order to describe intermediate stages on a trajectory.

They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, Place and Timespan are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of a spacetime volume is trivially its projection on time.\n\nExamples:\n- the spacetime Volume of the Event of Ceasars murder \n- the spacetime Volume where and when the carbon 14 dating of the \"Schoeninger Speer II\" in 1996  took place \n- the spatio‐temporal trajectory of the H.M.S. Victory from its building to its actual location\n- the spacetime volume defined by a polygon approximating the Danube river flood in Austria between 6th and 9th of August 2002\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE92(x) ⊃ E1(x)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
