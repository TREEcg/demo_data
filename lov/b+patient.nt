Topic salience is available for assignment to various arguments, including the patient, but Focus salience is always assigned to agent, and is therefore inaccessible to the patient or any other nominal. [Klaiman 1991: 236] Dayley describes the focus antipassive as a rearranging voice whose primary function is to indicate that the agent of a transitive sentence is highlighted or in focus. The focus antipassive is used when the agent is in contrastive focus or highly emphatic, when the agent is questioned, and when the agent is relativized.
