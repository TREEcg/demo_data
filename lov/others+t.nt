Differently from tagging, which 'selects' one of the references of a document, a topic actually points to an 'area of knowledge', which can be represented as a dul:Collection of dul:SocialObject(s) (e.g. of documents, concepts, meanings, etc.). \nA Topic is necessarily expressed by a iol:LinguisticObject.\nTopics have a typical topology, by which they can be distant, close, overlapping, etc., and a mereology, by which they can be part of others. This also means that 'areas of knowledge' can be part of others, can overlap, etc., so originating clusters of areas and terms that denote them.\nThe subcollection of terms populating a Topic is called here TopicSignature" <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .
