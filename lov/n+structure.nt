<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#ModificationFeature> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: An entity feature that represents  the covalently modified state of a dna, rna or a protein. \n\nRationale: In Biology, identity of DNA, RNA and Protein entities are defined around a wildtype sequence. Covalent modifications to this basal sequence are represented using modificaton features. Since small molecules are identified based on their chemical structure, not sequence, a covalent modification to a small molecule would result in a different molecule. \n\nUsage: The added groups should be simple and stateless, such as phosphate or methyl groups and are captured by the modificationType controlled vocabulary. In other cases, such as covalently linked proteins, use CovalentBindingFeature instead. \n\nInstances: A phosphorylation on a protein, a methylation on a DNA." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

<http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#GeometryRestructuration> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The GeometryRestructuration concept is a sub concept of the StructureChange concept. It describes changes that simultaneously affect several TSNFeature by modifying their Geometry and sometime other attributs of the TSNFeatures. The set of TSNFeatures (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the GeometryRestructuration event is determined following the rule described by (Plumejeaud C, Mathian H, Gensel J, Grasland C. Spatio-temporal analysis of territorial changes from a multi-scale perspective. International Journal of Geographical Information Science. 25, 1597–1612 (2011)):\"For any event type, a geometrical invariant defines the set of units involved in the one event: the combination of unit footprints that existed prior the event (preceding ones) is equal to the combination of unit footprints that are still in existence after the event (succeeding ones).\". Except in case of GeometryRestructuration caused by a TerritoryChange that affect the external boundaries of the TerritoryVersion observed. Then, in this case, the set of TSNFeature (TerritoryVersion, LevelVersion or UnitVersion) impacted by the StructureChange event is determined following the rule: changes are grouped together if they occur simultaneously, inside a area which extends from the new territory boundaries to unit(s) boundaries that match the ones of unit(s) before the event. This concept is equivalent to the \"evolution of spatial structure\" notion from (Claramunt C, Thériault M. Managing Time in GIS An Event-Oriented Approach. In: Clifford J, Tuzhilin A, editors. Recent Advances in Temporal Databases. London: Springer London; 1995. p. 23–42. Available from: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4471-3033-8_2)."@en <http://purl.org/net/tsnchange#> .
