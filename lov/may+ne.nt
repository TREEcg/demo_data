In particular it comprises plans for deliberate human activities that may result in the modification or production of instances of E24 Physical Thing.\n\nInstances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on others. This is modelled using P69 has association with (is associated with)..\n\nDesigns or procedures can be seen as one of the following:\n\n1. A schema for the activities it describes\n2. A schema of the products that result from their application.\n3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci's famous plans for flying machines.\n\nBecause designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CRM models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.\n\nExamples:\n- the ISO standardisation procedure\n- the musical notation of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\"\n- the architectural drawings for the Kölner Dom in Cologne, Germany\n- The drawing on the folio 860 of the Codex Atlanticus from Leonardo da Vinci, 1486-1490, kept in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE29(x) ⊃ E73(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<https://w3id.org/GConsent#MinorDataSubject> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A Minor is a Data Subject who cannot provide their own consent (that is legally valid). Therefore, their consent must be obtained via a Guardian or Legal Representative or Parent. Minor is a subclass of Data Subject.\n\nConsent given in lieu of a Minor (by their Representative) is associated with the `ConsentInstance` class/instance using the `wasGivenBy` property.\n\nThe ontology currently does not capture this relationship between the Minor and their Representative. This is due to required clarifications regarding how this role should be represented. For example, the `DataSubject` cannot be subclassed to create a `Representative` class, as this would make the `DataSubject` a permanent representative for the Minor. Instead, the role of 'acting as representative' is only for the instance of the given consent. Therefore, this could be represented with a `ConsentRepresentativeRole` class that links to the `MinorDataSubject` with `roleHadDataSubject` property, and the `DataSubject` that gave the consent via the `roleHadRepresentative` property. The relationship or reason or situation of this given consent can be captured by further annotating the `ConsentRepresentativeRole` instance. This approach can also be extended to other similar situations where one `DataSubject` gives consent in lieu of another.\n\nNote: A Minor can provide their own consent in certain cases, or conversely, a minor's consent may need to be provided by a 'parental' representative in some cases."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
