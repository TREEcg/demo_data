An alignment of sequences of known bovine MHCI gene cDNAs, as presented in the IPD-MHC database (May 2014), was used to design a series of 3_ (for) and 5_ (rev) pan-MHCI primers. cDNA from individual animals was subject to PCR amplification in two separate reactions using either the For1/Rev2 or the For3/Rev1 primer pairs. For each sample primers using a unique combination of MID tags were used to allow subsequent de-multiplexing of the sequence data. PCRs were conducted using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR kit. Following amplification, 5?_l of PCR products from each sample were pooled, purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads and run on a 1.5?% agarose gel. Bands of the appropriate size_ were extracted and purified using the Qiagen Gel extraction kit. Libraries were submitted to Edinburgh Genomics where after standard quality control procedures they underwent 300 base paired-end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq v3. Data were separated into reads generated from For1Rev2 and For3Rev1 primer pairs, generating separate datasets for up to 192 samples. Within each sample, reads were clustered into unique variants which were subsequently compared using BLAST against a database of the previously identified bovine MHCI sequences. This process identified >140 novel classical MHCI genes and defined 62 novel MHCI haplotypes, dramatically expanding the known bovine MHCI repertoire." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .
