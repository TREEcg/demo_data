<http://observedchange.com/tisc/ns#next> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "next is an abstract property to express that an object is a next object in the order, for example to state the \nlogical ordering of metro stations or bus stops, i.e. like in \"next metro station from Victoria is Sloane Square\". However, as such next is ambiguous as also \"next metro station from Victoria is St James's Park\" would be valid. This can be solved by e.g. having two instances of Victoria station for each direction, or using some similar type of mechanism. Note also that next is different from nextTo.
