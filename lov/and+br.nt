It allows types to be organised into hierarchies based on one type describing a typical part of another. This property is equivalent to \"broader term partitive (BTP)\" as defined in ISO 2788 and “broaderPartitive” in SKOS.\n\nExamples:\n- Car motors (E55) defines typical parts of cars (E55)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP150(x,y) ⊃ (E55 Type)\nP150(x,y) ⊃ E55(y)" <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://harmonet.org/harmonise.rdfs#Accommodation> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Accommodation aggregated concept is the primary accommodation entity. An accommodation is in one location and is managed by an organiser. It may physically consist of a number of buildings in proximity to one another. However, if an accommodation is spread across a number of locations then these are treated as multiple accommodations.\nAn accommodation may consist of a hotel, or a bed and breakfast, or a pension, or any other form of accommodation which provides private-room, catered services to guests. The self-catering and camping sectors are excluded from the scope of the accommodation concept. However, the accommodation ontology is structured in such a way as to facilitate the broadening of the sub domain in the future. \n\nAn accommodation is made up of a number of units (often bedrooms). The accommodation has facilities which are available on a per-accommodation basis (accommodation-level facilities), such as a swimming pool or car park. The units also have facilities, which are available on a per-unit basis (unit-level facilities), such as hair-dryers." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .
