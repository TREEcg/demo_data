The term Gratis Open Access thus signifies absence of a price barrier to view.  While both imply ‘free’ (a potentially ambiguous word), Gratis Open Access equates to ‘free as in beer’ while Libre Open Access (q.v.) equates to ‘free as in speech’.  Gratis Open Access is thus a necessary but not a sufficient condition for true Libre Open Access.   Many ‘open access’ publications by commercial scholarly publishers are only Gratis Open Access, while almost all publications by ‘pure’ Open Access scholarly publishers are Libre Open Access.
