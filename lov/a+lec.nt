This property can be used, for example, to describe references in a lecture reading list, where the cited references are relevant to the general topic of the lecture, but might not be individually cited within the text of the lecture.  Similarly, it could be used to describe items in a 'Suggested further reading' list at the end of a book chapter."@en <http://purl.org/spar/cito> .
