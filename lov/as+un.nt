<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/LogarithmicUnit> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Logarithmic units are abstract mathematical units that can be used to express any quantities (physical or mathematical) that are defined on a logarithmic scale, that is, as being proportional to the value of a logarithm function. Examples of logarithmic units include common units of information and entropy, such as the bit, and the byte, as well as units of relative signal strength magnitude such as the decibel."^^<http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#HTML> <http://qudt.org/schema/qudt> .
