<http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/muo#UnitOfMeasurement> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Measurement units are standards for measurement of physical properties or qualities. Every unit is related to a particular kind of property. For instance, the meter unit is uniquely related to the length property. Under our ontological approach, units are abstract spaces used as a reference metrics for quality spaces, such as physical qualia, and they are counted by some number. For instance, weight-units define some quality spaces for the weight-quality where specific weights of objects, like devices or persons, are located by means of comparisons with the proper weight-value of the selected weight-unit."@en <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/muo/ucum/> .
