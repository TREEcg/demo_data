The minimal components of a nanopublication are as follows:\n* the factual assertion itself, in the form subject, predicate and object (e.g. malaria is_a disease);\n* provenance information about the nanopublication, defining its authorship and creation date;\n* supporting information (optional), providing context for the assertion;\n* a unique identifier for the nanopublication, in the form of a URI;\n* an integrity key that ensures that the nanopublication is in its original form and has not been altered.\n"@en <http://purl.org/spar/fabio> .

<http://schema.org/additionalType> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally." <http://schema.org/> .
