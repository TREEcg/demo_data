<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#TemplateReaction> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definiton: An interaction where a macromolecule is polymerized from a \n    template macromolecule. \n\nRationale: This is an abstraction over multiple (not explicitly stated) biochemical \n    reactions. The ubiquitous molecules (NTP and amino acids) consumed are also usually\n    omitted. Template reaction is non-stoichiometric, does not obey law of \n    mass conservation and temporally non-atomic. It, however, provides a \n    mechanism to capture processes that are central to all living organisms.  \n\nUsage: Regulation of TemplateReaction, e.g. via a transcription factor can be \n    captured using TemplateReactionRegulation. TemplateReaction can also be \n    indirect  for example, it is not necessary to represent intermediary mRNA \n    for describing expression of a protein. It was decided to not subclass \n    TemplateReaction to subtypes such as transcription of translation for the \n    sake of  simplicity. If needed these subclasses can be added in the \n    future. \n\nExamples: Transcription, translation, replication, reverse transcription. E.g. \n    DNA to RNA is transcription, RNA to protein is translation and DNA to \n    protein is protein expression from DNA." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
