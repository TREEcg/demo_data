<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This ontology is a composition of some content design patterns for the semiotic triangle.\nIts structure is extracted from DOLCE-Ultralite (DOLCE+c.DnS), but it uses a different terminology, and explicitly defines the semiotic function: Expression is the semiotic term for dul:InformationObject, when they actually express or denote something; Meaning is the semiotic term for dul:SocialObject, when they are actually expressed by something, or are interpretation of something; Reference is the semiotic term for dul:Entity, when they are interpreted or denoted by something.\nThe denotes relation is equivalent to dul:isAbout, the expresses relation is imported from DOLCE Ultralite, and the hasInterpretation relation generalizes over: dul:isClassifiedBy, dul:isCoveredBy, dul:isDescribedBy, dul:isUnifiedBy, and dul:satisfies\n\nExtensions to the triangle:\nA typical extension of the semiotic triangle concerns the participation of agents: this is introduced by using the dul:conceptualizes relation, holding between a dul:Agent and a dul:SocialObject (the Meaning). \nAn additional extension concerns semiotic context: this is provided by including four notions of 'Context': 'Paradigm' (the context of the conceptualized meaning), 'KnowledgeCollective' (the context of agents that conceptualize the paradigm), 'Cotext' (the context of expressions), and dul:Situation (the context of denoted entities).\nA final extension links semiotics to formal semantics: this is provided by reusing dul:FormalEntity, iol:isGroundingFor, iol:FormalExpression, iol:isAssignedTo, iol:FormalLanguage, etc.\n\nThe complete pattern allows to declare relations between Expression(s) and their Reference(s) (denotes), between Expression(s) and their Meaning (dul:expresses), between Meaning(s) and Reference(s) (isInterpretationOf), between Reference(s) and dul:FormalEntity(ies) (iol:isGroundingFor), between dul:FormalEntity(ies) and iol:FormalExpression(s) (iol:isAssignedTo).\n\nThis 'formalization pathway' moves from Expression(s) to iol:FormalExpression(s) by taking into account both Meaning(s) and Referent(s). The informal denotation of Expression(s) is moved to a formal denotation (iol:isAssignedTo) of iol:FormalExpression(s).\nFor example: the Expression 'Mariachi' dul:expresses the dul:Concept (Meaning) 'MexicanStreetSinger' that isInterpretationOf the dul:Collection (Reference) 'TheStreetSingersFromMexico'. 'TheStreetSingersFromMexico' then iol:isGroundingFor e.g. the dul:Set (dul:FormalEntity) that includes all Mexican street singers, which iol:isAssignedTo e.g. the iol:FormalExpression 'owl:Class#Mariachi'.\n\nThe formalization pathway enables a technique to move from/to socio-cognitive and formal semantics through denotation, in the Tarskian sense. As a matter of fact, translating directly a Meaning into a FormalEntity (or viceversa) is not always clearly implementable, while passing through an extensional grounding is easier and more accessible to intuition.\n\nAmong possible uses, information extraction, ontology learning, KOS reengineering, lexical semantics, etc. For example, statistical learning of instances for a dul:Concept would be modelled as the building of a dul:Collection that isInterpretationOf the dul:Concept, but also dul:isGroundingFor a dul:Set that iol:isAssignedTo e.g. an owl:Class.\n\nAn additional semiotic pattern is based on the hasInterpretant relation, which allows to link two Expression(s) (or dul:InformationRealization(s)), when the second one counts as a Meaning (or a relatedMeaning) of the first. \nIn practice, this is implemented by allowing a relation between an Expression (or its realization), and whatever Meaning (or another dul:InformationRealization). Technically speaking, the correct path would be passing through another Expression used to express a Meaning for the first one:\n\n(Exp1 hasInterpretant some (Exp2 and expresses some (Meaning and isExpressedBy some Exp1)))\n\nor even:\n\n(Exp1 hasInterpretant some (Exp2 and expresses some (Meaning and relatedMeaning some (Meaning and isExpressedBy some Exp1))))\n\nbut given the expressive power of OWL, which lacks co-reference, this is the best sub-optimal solution."@en <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> .

Now, the formalization pathway goes from expression to meaning to reference to formal entity to formal expression.\n1.3 \n- has all elements with English labels. Moreover, I added the relatedMeaning property, which allows to query across all object properties that have a Meaning in both domain and range.\n1.4 \n- has a new relation: hasInterpretant, based on Peirce's semiotics, which is applied between any two Expression(s), where the second provides an interpretive context for the first.\n1.5 \n- fixes a bug in the domain and range of isContextOf, now both generalized to dul:Entity, and consequently, Context is equivalently defined as anything that isContextOf some dul:Entity; some comments have also been edited.\n1.6 \n- added equivalentClass axiom between lmm:Meaning and dul:SocialObject (simplifies applications).\n1.7 \n- aligned all locally defined object properties to dul:associatedWith.\n1.8\n- simplified several restrictions in the semiotic pattern core, for improving reasoning performance." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/lmm/LMM_L1.owl> .

<http://purl.org/iot/ontology/fiesta-iot#> <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description> "Many testbeds owning devices or applications interacting with the sensors, store their inherent observations and other related data in their own proprietary format. In other words, making a testbed independent and isolated from others that cannot directly interact with each other. Differences in the data format lead to interoperability issues between the testbeds and much work has to be done in order to ensure the compatibility. One has to understand different data formats and create the mapping between them. As a result, a testbed must understand other testbed's format and create the mapping both while sending and receiving information. One method to accomplish  interoperability is through the usage of semantic-based technologies to annotate all the information shared by the platforms. Nevertheless, some of the relevant existing ontologies promise interoperability but: \n\n- do not address the problem to describe the observation in an interoperable manner to ease further tasks, such as reasoning, \n- many of them are domain-specific and cannot be applied across domains, \n- they have missing concepts and do not suffice the needs of the measurements provided by the sensors, and \n- many ontologies do not follow best practices making it hard to correctly interpret and reuse concepts.\n\n\nIn order to address the above-mentioned limitations, we provide FIESTA-IoT ontology (a unified semantic model) that follows best practices. FIESTA-IoT Ontology is a merge of concepts from various ontologies such as IoT-lite, M3-lite Taxonomy, SSN, Time and DUL (see Figure 1). The FIESTA-IoT Ontology is diveded into 2 parts: resourse description and observations produced. One has to follow the Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively, for understanding what all concepts are associated with resourse description and observation. Using such information testbeds can annotate their data to FIESTA-IoT specific requirements and the annotators developed can achieve FIESTA-IoT certification.\n\n\nFor more detials please see:\n\n- R.
