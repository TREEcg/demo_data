In particular it comprises plans for deliberate human activities that may result in the modification or production of instances of E24 Physical Thing.\n\nInstances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on others. This is modelled using P69 has association with (is associated with)..\n\nDesigns or procedures can be seen as one of the following:\n\n1. A schema for the activities it describes\n2. A schema of the products that result from their application.\n3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci's famous plans for flying machines.\n\nBecause designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CRM models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.\n\nExamples:\n- the ISO standardisation procedure\n- the musical notation of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\"\n- the architectural drawings for the Kölner Dom in Cologne, Germany\n- The drawing on the folio 860 of the Codex Atlanticus from Leonardo da Vinci, 1486-1490, kept in the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE29(x) ⊃ E73(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

However, P65 shows visual item (is shown by) differs from the P62 depicts (is depicted by) property in that it makes no claims about what the E36 Visual Item is deemed to represent. E36 Visual Item identifies a recognisable image or visual symbol, regardless of what this image may or may not represent.\n\nFor example, all recent British coins bear a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, a fact that is correctly documented using P62 depicts (is depicted by). Different portraits have been used at different periods, however. P65 shows visual item (is shown by) can be used to refer to a particular portrait.\nP65 shows visual item (is shown by) may also be used for Visual Items such as signs, marks and symbols, for example the 'Maltese Cross' or the 'copyright symbol’ that have no particular representational content.\n\nThis property is part of the fully developed path from E24 Physical Man-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity which is shortcut by, P62 depicts (is depicted by).\n\nExamples:\n- My T-Shirt (E22) shows visual item Mona Lisa (E38)\n\nIn First Order Logic: P65(x,y) ⊃ E24(x)\nP65(x,y) ⊃ E36(y)\nP65(x,y) ⊃ P128(x,y)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
