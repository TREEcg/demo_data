<http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/04/02/ncal#created> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This property specifies the date and time that the calendar information was created by the calendar user agent in the calendar store. Note: This is analogous to the creation date and time for a file in the file system. Inspired by RFC 2445 sec. 4.8.7.1. Note that this property is a subproperty of nie:created. The domain of nie:created is nie:DataObject. It is not a superclass of UnionOf_Vevent_Vjournal_Vtodo, but since that union is conceived as an 'abstract' class, and in real-life all resources referenced by this property will also be DataObjects, than this shouldn't cause too much of a problem. Note that RFC allows ONLY UTC time values for this property." <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/04/02/ncal> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E16_Measurement> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic procedure.\n\nExamples include measuring the monetary value of a collection of coins or the running time of a specific video cassette.\n\nThe E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Details of methods and devices are best handled as free text, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon 14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of:) E55 Type.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of height of silver cup 232 on the 31st August 1997\n- the carbon 14 dating of the \"Schoeninger Speer II\" in 1996 [an about 400.000 years old Palaeolithic complete wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany in 1995]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE16(x) âŠƒ E13(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
