This check must also be extended to all Choices or Components implicitly included via coo:includes.\nNote 4: If you want to know whether some components may be omitted without invalidating the configuration, check that there are no coo:dependsOn relationships with any Choice or Component. This check must also be extended to all Choices Or Components implicitly included via coo:includes.\nNote 5: Under an Open World Assumption (OWA), only an explicit compatibility statement for your configuration is really reliable. A weaker guarantee may be sufficient for your application, though."@en <http://purl.org/coo/ns#> .
