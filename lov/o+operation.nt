<https://w3id.org/GConsent#Processing> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Processing is defined by the GDPR (Article 4-2) as \"any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\".\n\nProcessing can be considered as the action, within an activity for example, that uses data in a particular or specific way. Therefore, processing specifies what is happening to/with the data. \n\nTo define a type of processing (or its associated action), the Processing class should be subclassed for each type. Furthermore, each subclass should define a instance as a generic representative of that action. For example, \"collect\" as a type of processing (defined by the GDPR), is defined as the class DataCollection, which is a subclass of Processing, and has the individual CollectionOfPersonalData to represent a generic instance of the concept. This is to provide a ready-to-use ontology in terms of \"collect\" as an action, while also providing a way to specialise the action/processing.\nGConsent defines several such types of processing taken from the text of the GDPR."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .

<https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/lampBallastType> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The type of ballast used to stabilise gas discharge by limiting the current during operation and to deliver the necessary striking voltage for starting. Ballasts are needed to operate Discharge Lamps such as Fluorescent, Compact Fluorescent, High-pressure Mercury, Metal Halide and High-pressure Sodium Lamps. Magnetic ballasts are chokes which limit the current passing through a lamp connected in series on the principle of self-induction. The resultant current and power are decisive for the efficient operation of the lamp. A specially designed ballast is required for every type of lamp to comply with lamp rating in terms of Luminous Flux, Color Appearance and service life. The two types of magnetic ballasts for fluorescent lamps are KVG Conventional (EC-A series) and VVG Low-loss ballasts (EC-B series). Low-loss ballasts have a higher efficiency, which means reduced ballast losses and a lower thermal load. Electronic ballasts are used to run fluorescent lamps at high frequencies (approx. 35 - 40 kHz)."@en <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4bldg/> .
