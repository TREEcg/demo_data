<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Plan> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Plan A plan is a sequence of actions devised by an agent to achieve some Goal.\n            In the BDI model, the agent's 'intention' to execute a plan is the bridge\n            between goals and practical actions. In Drammar, a plan is intended by (intendedBy\n            object property) an Agent to achieve (achieve property) some Goal. As a consequence, the\n            plan motivates (isMotivationFor object property) a timeline (i.e. a given extent of the\n            drama text). These are the necessary and sufficient conditions of class. Following the\n            paradigm of hierarchical planning, plans are recursive. So plans can contains actions or\n            other, simpler plans. Formally, a Plan is a list (namely, it is a subclass of the List\n            class) whose elements are simpler plans (for abstract plans) or actions (for directly\n            executable plans). A plan is related to its elements by the containsOLE\n            property." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
