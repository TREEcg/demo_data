The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue. Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras. Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies (CRT, LCD, plasma, etc.), computer and mobile phone displays, video projectors, multicolor LED displays, and large screens as JumboTron, etc. Color printers, on the other hand, are usually not RGB devices, but subtractive color devices (typically CMYK color model).\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"RGB\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .
