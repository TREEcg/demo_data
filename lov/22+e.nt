These individuals could\n            also be a bridge to some commonsense ontology, such as YagoSumo for Values, but it would\n            be different from the adoption of the OCC theory, as committed in\n            Drammar." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Emotion> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Emotion is the class of emotions felt by an agent in a scene. Formally, it is\n            described as the subclass of MentalState described by an EmotionSchema. The emotions\n            refer to OCC emotion ontology (22 emotions types). Emotion type is an external resource\n            (ExternalRefEmotionType). An Emotion has an appraising agent (appraisingAgent object\n            property) and, when appraised, is an emotion of (isEmotionOf object property) that\n            agent. An emotion also has a target (the agent or object that is the target of the\n            emotion): a specifi object property connects each emotion type with its target (e.g.,\n            shame_target, love_target, etc.)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
