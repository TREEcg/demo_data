Compounds that activate the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.\n\nThe following term can not be used in the catalysis class:\nINHIBITION: General inhibition. Compounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by an unknown mechanism. The mechanism is defined as unknown, because either the mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the experimental literature, or the paper(s) curated thus far do not define the mechanism, and a full literature search has yet to be performed.\n\nThe following terms can only be used in the modulation class (these definitions from EcoCyc):\nINHIBITION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric inhibitors decrease the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that decreases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX. Allosteric inhibitors can be competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors, therefore, those inhibition categories can be used in conjunction with this category.\n\nINHIBITION-COMPETITIVE\nCompetitive inhibitors are compounds that competitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and preventing the substrate from binding. Binding of the inhibitor and substrate are mutually exclusive because it is assumed that the inhibitor and substrate can both bind only to the free enzyme. A competitive inhibitor can either bind to the active site of the enzyme, directly excluding the substrate from binding there, or it can bind to another site on the enzyme, altering the conformation of the enzyme such that the substrate can not bind to the active site.\n\nINHIBITION-IRREVERSIBLE\nIrreversible inhibitors are compounds that irreversibly inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme and dissociating so slowly that it is considered irreversible. For example, alkylating agents, such as iodoacetamide, irreversibly inhibit the catalytic activity of some enzymes by modifying cysteine side chains.\n\nINHIBITION-NONCOMPETITIVE\nNoncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that noncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme by binding reversibly to both the free enzyme and to the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor and substrate may be bound to the enzyme simultaneously and do not exclude each other. However, only the enzyme-substrate complex (not the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex) is catalytically active.\n\nINHIBITION-OTHER\nCompounds that inhibit the specified enzyme activity by a mechanism that has been characterized, but that cannot be clearly classified as irreversible, competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, or allosteric.\n\nINHIBITION-UNCOMPETITIVE\nUncompetitive inhibitors are compounds that uncompetitively inhibit the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex but not to the enzyme alone.\n\nACTIVATION-NONALLOSTERIC\nNonallosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by means other than allosteric.\n\nACTIVATION-ALLOSTERIC\nAllosteric activators increase the specified enzyme activity by binding reversibly to the enzyme and inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme to its substrates without affecting its VMAX." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .
