<http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfprov> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The wfprov ontology shows how to express minimal provenance information about the execution of a workflow described using the wf ontology. \n\nHere the concern is mainly the provenance which affects the research object, so in particular how some ro:Resource's might have been generated or used by the execution of a wfdesc:Workflow.\n\nThe main class here is a wfprov:WorkflowRun which shows how wfprov:Artifact instances (the data) wfprov:wasOutputFrom a wfprov:ProcessRun for generated artifacts, or wfprov:usedInput for consumed artifacts. The WorkflowRun is also a ProcessRun, and so the overall inputs and outputs of thw workflow execution can be described in the same manner.\n\nThese provenance details are linked to the corresponding wfdesc descriptions using wfdesc:describedbyProcess, wfdesc:describedByWorkflow and wfdesc:describedByParameter.\n\n\nThis ontology can be further linked to more specific provenance ontologies like OPM-V or W3C PROV-O, but this should be done separately."@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/wfprov> .

If this is not the case, a copy of the now valid graph must be created and attached to a new geometry state. If an object within the geometry graph is changed (e.g. changing the primitive \"Box\" into a primitive \"Sphere\"), the old primitive (\"Box\") should be classified as opm:Deleted and the new primitive (\"Sphere\") should be added to the geometry graph in the correct place. The new geometry state should then be connected to any object of the geometry graph that is not opm:Deleted using the omg:containsGeometryObject relation.\nMetadata of a geometry state must as a minimum be the time of generation stated by prov:generatedAtTime, but preferably also a prov:wasAttributedTo reference to the agent who created the state. In case properties are changed using the OPM concepts, the most current time of generation and agent who created the state will be determined using the omg:containsPropertyState relation.\nDerived geometry descriptions are also stored as states as these change when the base geometry changes."@en <https://w3id.org/omg> .
