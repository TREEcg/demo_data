It can be used widely to talk about document annotations, subject directories, etc.\nThe range is here relaxed to any SocialObject, in order to allow alignment of deviant uses of topic or subject relations for 'concepts' (e.g. in thesauri), and other things that are mixed up with the notion of Topic.\nThis move makes the hasTopic relation very general, and introduces a particular semiotic relation, different from dul:expresses, lmm1:denotes, and lmm1:isInterpretationOf: this is a relation between any two social objects, in which the first is (or is related to) some lmm1:Meaning that dul:isMemberOf a dul:Collection (a Topic). The second social object can even be another member of that Topic. Hence, in the general case, we could expect a relation between two social objects that are associated because they are members of a common Topic.\nFor example, consider the following cases:\n(1) A biography of Brigitte Bardot (dul:InformationObject) ontopic:hasTopic 'star system' (Topic)\n(2) The concept of 'starlet' (dul:Concept) hasTopic 'cinema' (Topic)\n(3) A biography of Claude Chabrol (dul:InformationObject) ontopic:hasTopic 'Nouvelle Vague' (Topic)" <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/ontopic.owl> .

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DramaEndurant> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DramaEndurant is an entity of drama that can be described as an endurant\n            following Gangemi et al. 2002. In Gangemi et al. 2002 \"Endurants are wholly present\n            (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present\",\n            differently from perdurants, which are only partially present at any time they are\n            present. Endurants (and Perdurants, in some cases) play a role in processes and states:\n            an Endurant is connected to a role (Role class) in the description of a given process or\n            state by the hasRole object property. The class of drama endurants encompasses more\n            specific drama entities such as Agent and Object. This bipartite distinction is derived\n            from the drama literature, where - Agents that intentionally perform actions; - Objects\n            are involved in the actions in an unintentional way. For instance, in Hamlet, the King\n            of England is a drama endurant (but non an agent) because it is the filler of a role in\n            Claudius' actions (sending ... ) but does not intend any plan (a feature would\n            locate it in the Agent class). The difference beteween the King of England and a coffee\n            machine is entrusted to common sense knowlegde (e.g., the external lexical knowledge\n            stating the sementic type of these two entities).

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Goal> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The Goal class represents the objectives of an agent. In the BDI model, the\n            agent is driven by her desires, or goal, and forms plans to achieve them. In Drammar, a\n            goal is achieved by a plan; the achives object property connects a plan with the goal it\n            achieves (a single goal, since the achieves property is functional). An agent intends\n            (intends object property) a goal. Formally, the Goal class is a defined as a subclass of\n            the MentalState class which is constrained: - to be the goal of some agent - to be part\n            of some ConsistentStateState - to be described by a GoalSchema Goal has a propositional\n            content that is - a process in the case of perform goal PG (Hamlet wants to ask Ophelia\n            ...) - a state in the case of - achievement (Hamlet wants Ophelia goes to a nunnery) -\n            maintenance (Hamlet wants Claudius (keeps) believing Hamlet is mad) - query (Hamlet\n            wants to know whether Ophelia is honest) In these various cases the propositional\n            content is different: - Perform Goal - PC: Action - AG - PC: State, embedded in one\n            Belief, with status false or Process, embedded in Belief, with accomplishment false - MG\n            - PC: State or Process, embedded in Belief, with status/accomplishment true - Query Goal\n            - PC: depends on query; e.g.: - Y/N question: the boolean status of a state (currently\n            implemented as a State with status TRUE) - Wh question: the filler of a role in some\n            state or process (currently not implemented) These are guidelines for writing the plans\n            correctly." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
