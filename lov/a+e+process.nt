A dul:Object is any physical, social, or mental object, or a substance.\n\nPrototypical process executors are Sensor, Actuator, Estimator.\n\nLinks to ProcessExecution describe the Executions made.\n\nLinks to Processes define how the executor can make Executions (it may implement several Processes).
