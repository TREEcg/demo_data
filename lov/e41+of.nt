Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e., other instances of E41 Appellation that are always regarded as equivalent independent from the thing it denotes. \n\nSpecific subclasses of E41 Appellation should be used when instances of E41 Appellation of a characteristic form are used for particular objects. Instances of E49 Time Appellation, for example, which take the form of instances of E50 Date, can be easily recognised.\n\nE41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something. Cf. E15 Identifier Assignment \n\nExamples:\n- \"Martin\" \n- \"the Forth Bridge\"\n- \"the Merchant of Venice\" (E35)\n- \"Spigelia marilandica (L.) L.\" [not the species, just the name]\n- \"information science\" [not the science itself, but the name through which we refer to it in an English-speaking context] \n- “安” [Chinese \"an\", meaning \"peace\"]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE41(x) ⊃ E90(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

It is a dynamic asymmetric relationship, where the range expresses the derivative, if such a direction can be established. Otherwise, the relationship is symmetric. The relationship is not transitive.\n\nThe equivalence applies to all cases of use of an instance of E41 Appellation. Multiple names assigned to an object, which are not equivalent for all things identified with a specific instance of E41 Appellation, should be modelled as repeated values of P1 is identified by (identifies).\n\nP139.1 has type allows the type of derivation, such as “transliteration from Latin 1 to ASCII” be refined..\n\nExamples:\n- \"Martin Doerr\" (E41) has alternative form \"Martin Dörr\" (E41) has type Alternate spelling (E55)\n- \"Гончарова, Наталья Сергеевна\" (E41) has alternative form \"Gončarova, Natal´â Sergeevna\" (E41) has type ISO 9:1995 transliteration (E55)\n- \"Αθήνα\" has alternative form \"Athina\" has type transcription.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nP139(x,y) ⊃ E41(x)\nP139 (x,y) ⊃ E41(y)\nP139(x,y,z) ⊃ [P139(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\nP139(x,y) ⊃ P139(y,x)\n\nProperties: P139.1 has type: E55 Type"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.\n\nExamples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.\n\nThe fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as \"preferred identifier assignment\", to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.\n\nExamples:\n- Replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens\n- Assigning the author-uniform title heading \"Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832. Faust. 1. Theil.\" for a work (E28)\n- On June 1, 2001 assigning the personal name heading \"Guillaume, de Machaut, ca. 1300-1377\" (E42,E82) to Guillaume de Machaut (E21)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE15(x) ⊃ E13(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
