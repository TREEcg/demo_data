<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#EntityReference> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition: An entity reference is a grouping of several physical entities across different contexts and molecular states, that share common physical properties and often named and treated as a single entity with multiple states by biologists. \n\nRationale:   Many protein, small molecule and gene databases share this point of view, and such a grouping is an important prerequisite for interoperability with those databases. Biologists would often group different pools of molecules in different contexts under the same name. For example cytoplasmic and extracellular calcium have different effects on the cell's behavior, but they are still called calcium. For DNA, RNA and Proteins the grouping is defined based on a wildtype sequence, for small molecules it is defined by the chemical structure.\n\nUsage: Entity references store the information common to a set of molecules in various states described in the BioPAX document, including database cross-references. For instance, the P53 protein can be phosphorylated in multiple different ways. Each separate P53 protein (pool) in a phosphorylation state would be represented as a different protein (child of physicalEntity) and all things common to all P53 proteins, including all possible phosphorylation sites, the sequence common to all of them and common references to protein databases containing more information about P53 would be stored in a Entity Reference.  \n\nComments: This grouping has three semantic implications:\n\n1.  Members of different pools share many physical and biochemical properties. This includes their chemical structure, sequence, organism and set of molecules they react with. They will also share a lot of secondary information such as their names, functional groupings, annotation terms and database identifiers.\n\n2. A small number of transitions seperates these pools. In other words it is relatively easy and frequent for a molecule to transform from one physical entity to another that belong to the same reference entity. For example an extracellular calcium can become cytoplasmic, and p53 can become phosphorylated. However no calcium virtually becomes sodium, or no p53 becomes mdm2. In the former it is the sheer energy barrier of a nuclear reaction, in the latter sheer statistical improbability of synthesizing the same sequence without a template. If one thinks about the biochemical network as molecules transforming into each other, and remove edges that respond to transcription, translation, degradation and covalent modification of small molecules, each remaining component is a reference entity.\n\n3. Some of the pools in the same group can overlap. p53-p@ser15 can overlap with p53-p@thr18. Most of the experiments in molecular biology will only check for one state variable, rarely multiple, and never for the all possible combinations. So almost all statements that refer to the state of the molecule talk about a pool that can overlap with other pools. However no overlaps is possible between molecules of different groups." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

Some connectors are gold or rhodium plated, while some connectors use nickel or tin plating. Silver is also used due to its excellent conductivity.

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state.\n\nMore theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).\nHere no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time.\nIf a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.\n\n(1) Alternative aspectual views\n\nConsider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one). \nIn the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).\n\nThe different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox? \nA typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude.\nAn alternative solution is applied here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity. \nFor example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'.\nConsider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.\n\n(2) Alternative intentionality views\n\nSimilarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces.\nAlso in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event. \nOn the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it. \nTherefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.\n\n(3) Alternative participant views\n\nA slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them. \nFor example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change.\nAnyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).\n\nUltimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it. \nBoth positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which only attempt to assist domain experts in representing what they want to conceptualize a certain portion of reality according to their own ideas. \nFor this reason, in this ontology both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions, in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the designer." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl> .
