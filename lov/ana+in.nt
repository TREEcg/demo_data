In digital applications it's usually referred to as \"576i\", in analogue contexts it's often quoted as \"625 lines\". The 576 identifies a vertical resolution of 576 lines (usually with a horizontal resolution of 720 or 704 pixels), and the i identifies it as an interlaced resolution.\n\n(This description is partly based on or reuses content from the Wikipedia article \"576ii\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/576i) and is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).)"@en <http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/ontologies/consumerelectronics/v1> .

This is the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Molluscs are highly diverse, not only in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. (Wikipedia)"@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protonext> .
