<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DramaEndurant> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DramaEndurant is an entity of drama that can be described as an endurant\n            following Gangemi et al. 2002. In Gangemi et al. 2002 \"Endurants are wholly present\n            (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present\",\n            differently from perdurants, which are only partially present at any time they are\n            present. Endurants (and Perdurants, in some cases) play a role in processes and states:\n            an Endurant is connected to a role (Role class) in the description of a given process or\n            state by the hasRole object property. The class of drama endurants encompasses more\n            specific drama entities such as Agent and Object. This bipartite distinction is derived\n            from the drama literature, where - Agents that intentionally perform actions; - Objects\n            are involved in the actions in an unintentional way. For instance, in Hamlet, the King\n            of England is a drama endurant (but non an agent) because it is the filler of a role in\n            Claudius' actions (sending ... ) but does not intend any plan (a feature would\n            locate it in the Agent class). The difference beteween the King of England and a coffee\n            machine is entrusted to common sense knowlegde (e.g., the external lexical knowledge\n            stating the sementic type of these two entities).

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#SituationSchema> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The situation schema provides the pattern for the description of incidents and states. It is inspired by the Situation ontology Pattern of the Ontology Design Pattern initiative (http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/). So, a SituationSchema describes (\"describes\" object property) a DramaPerdurant (either a State or a Process).\nThe schema works as a hub for the roles involved in a situation. The property hasRole links the Situation class (its domain) with the Role class (the range of the property). Also, notice that, as illustrated in the documentation of the SituationSchema class, a Situation Schema (or, better, its subclasses) does not directly refer to the external linguistic knowledge employed to describe drama: rather, it refers to the ExternalRefSchema class (subclass of the top level ExternalReference class), which in  turn refers to the linguistic knowledge. The SituationSchema class specializes into specific schemata for describing specific type of situations: \n- FrameNetSchema: for describing processes, like giving or killing (in Drammar, they are grouped into units arranged on timelines), and states, like being behind some object or being dead (in Drammar, they are bundled into sets that border timelines and plans). \n- MentalStateSchema: this class groups the specific types of schemata for describing the mental states of the agents in Drammar, namely beliefs, goals, emotions and values. \nTechnically, the subtypes of SituationSchema are characterized by different values of the quale_schemaType data property: \"belief\", \"emotion\", \"framenet\", \"goal\",  \"value\". \nFinally, it is worth mentioning that is a specific design choice of Drammar not to represent the nesting of states: only the type of the top level state, e.g., a belief, is represented, independent of what that belief contains in turn. This flat style of representation is determined by the decision not to commit to a specific logical account of state types. When Drammar is employed for annotation, the content nested into a state is described informally in natural language description accompanying the state, if needed. \nRefs: Gangemi, A., & Presutti, V.

The DramaEdurant is the class of elements of Drama that describe the\n            story dynamics, i.e. Processes and States. In the context of Drammar, the individuals of\n            this class describe the story advancement in terms of incidents and states holding\n            between incidents. Each has a specific relation to the segmentation of drama: processes\n            are grouped in units, states precedes and follows timelines (which contain units).\n            Notice that processes and states are not distinct in Framenet, the knowledge source we\n            refer to for describing perdurants outside of Drammar.
