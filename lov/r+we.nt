A string is a Word, if it is a word. We don't nitpic about whether it is a a pronoun, a name, a punctuation mark or an apostrophe or whether it is separated by white space from another Word or something else. The string 'He enters the room.' for example has 5 words. Words are assigned by a tokenizer NIF Implementation. Single word phrases might be tagged as nif:Word and nif:Phrase. \n    \n    Example 1: \"The White House\" are three Words separated by whitespace\n        \n    Comment 1: We adopted the definition style from foaf:Person, see here: http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Person We are well aware that the world out there is much more complicated, but we are ignorant about it, for the following reasons:\n    Comment 2:  \n    \n    1. NIF has a client-server and the client has the ability to dictate the tokenization to the server (i.e. the NIF Implementation) by sending properly tokenized NIF annotated with nif:Word. All NIF Implementations are supposed to honor and respect the current assignment of the Word class. Thus the client should decide which NIF Implementation should create the tokenization. Therefore this class is not descriptive, but prescriptive.\n    2. The client may choose to send an existing tokenization to a NIF Implementation, with the capability to change (for better or for worse) the tokenization. \n    \n    \n   \n    The class has not been named 'Token' as the NLP definition of 'token' is descriptive (and not well-defined), while the assignment of what is a Word and what not is prescriptive, e.g. \"can't\" could be described as one, two or three tokens or defined as being one, two or three words. For further reading, we refer the reader to: By all these lovely tokens... Merging conflicting tokenizations by Christian Chiarcos, Julia Ritz, and Manfred Stede. Language Resources and Evaluation 46(1):53-74 (2012) or the short form: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-3005\n    There the task at hand is to merge two tokenization T_1 and T_2 which is normally not the case in the NIF world as tokenization is prescribed, i.e. given as a baseline (Note that this ideal state might not be achieved by all implementations.)\n    \n    Changelog:\n    * 0.1.1 fixed spelling\n    * 0.2.1 added a proper definition.\n    * 0.2.3 added examples and clarifications\n    "@en <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/nif-core#> .

<http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/examples/2> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "<p>\n\n      The relationship vocabulary can be used to describe relationships with the people linked from a web page. This is particularly useful for blogrolls or contact lists but can be used with any type of link. The HTML <code>a</code> element provides two attributes, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#adef-rel\">rel and rev</a>, that can be used to specify the relationship. Both <code>rel</code> and <code>rev</code> take a space separated list of keywords as their value. To use a term from the relationship vocabulary just drop the <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> namespace to leave the property name, e.g. <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/worksWith</code> would become <code>worksWith</code> which can be added as the value of <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code>.\n    </p>\n    <dl>\n      <dt>\n        <code>rel</code>\n      </dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>\n          The <code>rel</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linked</em> page has with the author of the <em>linking</em> page.\n          For example:\n        </p>\n        <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rel</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n        <p>This link states that the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code> is a child of the author of the html above. </p>\n      </dd>\n      <dt>\n        <code>rev</code>\n      </dt>\n      <dd>\n        <p>\n          The <code>rev</code> attribute specifies a relationship that the author of the <em>linking</em> page has with the author of the   <em>linked</em> page. The example here is:\n        </p>\n        <pre><code><span class=\"elem\">&lt;a</span><span class=\"attr\">href</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">http://example.com/boats</span>\" <span class=\"attr highlight\">rev</span>=\"<span class=\"attrVal\">childOf</span>\"<span class=\"elem\">&gt;</span><span class=\"text\">The boat we restored</span><span class=\"elem\">\"&lt;/a&gt;</span></code></pre>\n        <p>In this case the meaning of the link is reversed: the author of the html above is a child of the author of <code>http://example.com/boats</code>.</p>\n      </dd>\n    </dl>\n    <p>The HTML and XHTML recommendations require an HTML document to declare a custom profile if it uses any non-standard <code>rel</code> or <code>rev</code> types. This is done by adding a <code>profile</code> attribute with a value of <code>http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/</code> to the document's <code>head</code> element. </p>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;head profile=\"http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>\n    <h3>Complete Example</h3>\n    <pre><code>  &lt;html profile=\"http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/\"&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;People I Know&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;Here are the people I know:&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~freddy\" rel=\"closeFriendOf\"&gt;Freddy (he's cool!)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://frooble.com/\" rel=\"mentorOf\"&gt;Jimbo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://mmmm.com/klm\" rel=\"friendOf\"&gt;Katie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~omah\" rel=\"worksWith\"&gt;Omah (does the coding)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://example.com/~jason\" rev=\"closeFriendOf employedBy\"&gt;Jason, my henchman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n    <h3>RDF Interpretation</h3>\n    <p>Custom parsers that extract RDF from (X)HTML can use the relationships expressed in the links to infer the\n  equivilent RDF triples.

This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\n\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\n\nAs the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.\n\nWhether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.\n\nConsequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.\n\nWe model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\n\nThere are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\n\nAnother specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\nJurassic\nEuropean Bronze Age\nItalian Renaissance\nThirty Years War\nSturm und Drang\nCubism\n\nIn First Order Logic: \nE4(x) ⊃ E2(x)\nE4(x) ⊃ E92(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

The term 'line' is used when a culture has undergone an intentional experimental process to establish a more uniform and stable population of cells (see 'establishing cell line'). This will require one or more passages, but may involve additional selection processes. Through such passaging and/or selection processes, the resulting 'line' attains some level of genetic stability and compositional homogeneity which is typically absent in primary cultures. Because of their relative homogeneity, 'lines' are capable of being characterized and stably propagated over a period of time. A *new* cell line can be \"established\" not only through the passaging/selection of a primary culture, but also through experimental modifications of existing lines (e.g. immortalization, stable genetic modifications, drug selection for a resistant subset, etc.).  As defined here,  'cell line' can refer to a population of cells in active culture, applied experimentally, or stored in a quescent state for future use. \n\n2. The definitional criteria provided here for the 'cell line' class demarcates populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - e.g. as inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The definition is such that cell lines will exhibit important attributes. For example, they will have a relatively homogenous cell type composition as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. In addition, these populations can also be characterized by a passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.?\n\n3. Definitinal criteria are intended to be sufficiently clear to specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world. A 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this common history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to the collection of all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as cells in these collections will likely not all share a common culture history. Rather, 'HeLa cell line' could refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).  As noted above, it is such collections that are typically referred to in scientific discourse and publications.\n\n4. Notably, the term 'line' has been alternately used by other terminologies and communities to refer to cultures that have been immortalized - ie has attained the capacity for indefinite propagation in vitro.  In this ontology, we refer to such cell lines as 'immortal cell lines', and use the term 'cell line' to indicate any culture that has been passaged." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .

Subclass axioms were: 'has grain' some 'cell line cell' and 'has grain' only 'cell line cell'\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: There is considerable ambiguity and inconsistent usage surrounding the term 'cell line' across biomedical communities. For exmaple, it can refer to the maximal collection of all cells in a cultured lineage (e.g. the colelction of all HeLa cells that exist), or to discrete portions of this maximal collection that are stored, exchanged, and applied experimentally (e.g. the dish of HeLa cells I am using in my experiment). A working group of representatives from OBI, CLO, and CL was assembled in spring of 2013 to harmonize modeling and terminology surrounding experimentally cultured cells across Open Biomedical Ontologies, following OBO Foundry principles of orthogonality and re-use. A consensus was reached to apply the term 'cell line' to refer not to a maximal collection of cells of a given type, but to discrete populations of cultured cells that share a common propagation history which has conferred a certain a genetic stability and compositional homogeneity to the population.  This meaning reflects its most common usage in domain discourse, and will best support data annotation requirements. This view means that a 'HeLa cell line' would be a subset of all HeLa cells in the world - specifically any subset that has been derived through a shared continuous lineage wherein the cells have always been passaged together and thereby evolved together through the selective pressures imposed by this specific history. Accordingly, 'HeLa cell line' would not be used to refer to collections such as all HeLa cells in a given lab, or all HeLa cells in the ATCC repository, as all cells in these collections do not necessarily share a common culture history. Rather, it could be used to refer to the collection of cells I am culturing at a given moment, or that I apply in an experiment (as such collections typically meet the criteria of having a shared propagation history).\n\nThis approach seems to accomplish several desirable goals:\n1) It allows us to define the term 'cell line' for the community in a precise way that also reflects how the term is most commonly used in the literature and scientific discourse.\n(2) It gives a definition that provides clear criteria to help specify what are and what are not instances of 'cell lines' in the real world\n(3) The criteria it provides demarcate populations that represent what researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history.\n(4) The definition seems to be true to the meaning of the word 'line' - which is suggests a specific lineage of derivation." <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/obi.owl> .
