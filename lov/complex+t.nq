In case of L1, a task is directly connected with the task method description. When using L2, a task is first connected to an intermediate property node via cp:hasTaskMethod. The intermediate node is then connected using cp:hasComplexTaskMethodDescription. In case of L3, the first intermediate node from L2 receives an outgoing opm:hasPropertyState property. The property state node is then connected to the task method description using cp:hasComplexTaskMethodDescrription. A task method description contains a step-by-step description of the procedure, used materials and equipment."@en <https://w3id.org/cto> .
