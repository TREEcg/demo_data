<https://saref.etsi.org/saref4inma/Measurement> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "A subclass of saref:Measurement that represents the measured value made over a property. It is also linked to the unit of measure in which the value is expressed and the timestamp of the measurement. The saref4imna:Measurement can be linked to individual Batches or Items. Moreover, the Measurement can be an ExpectedMeasurement (i.e. the value which is planned) or the ActualMeasurement (i.e. the value measured during production), which enables to check for deviations between the planned and actual values." <https://saref.etsi.org/saref4inma/> .
