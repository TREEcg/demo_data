The result shall be multiplied by 100 and expressed as a percentage.\n5.5.2 Supporting indicator requirements\n\nUnemployed youth shall refer to individuals above the legal working age and under 24 years of age who are without work, actively seeking work in a recent past period (past four weeks), and currently available for work. Youth who did not look for work but have a future labour market stake (arrangements for a future job start) are counted as unemployed (International Labour Organization). Discouraged workers or hidden unemployed shall not be counted as unemployed or as part of the labour force. Not actively seeking work shall refer to people who have not taken active steps to seek work (i.e. job searches, interviews, informational meetings etc.) during a specified recent period (usually the past four weeks).\n\nYouth labour force shall refer to all persons above the legal working age and under 24 years of age, who are either employed or unemployed over a specified reference period.\n\nNOTE Countries vary somewhat in their operational definitions of youth, in particular, the lower age limit for young people is usually determined by the minimum age for leaving school, where this exists."@en <http://ontology.eil.utoronto.ca/ISO37120.owl> .
