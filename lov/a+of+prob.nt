<http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/04/02/ncal#created> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "This property specifies the date and time that the calendar information was created by the calendar user agent in the calendar store. Note: This is analogous to the creation date and time for a file in the file system. Inspired by RFC 2445 sec. 4.8.7.1. Note that this property is a subproperty of nie:created. The domain of nie:created is nie:DataObject. It is not a superclass of UnionOf_Vevent_Vjournal_Vtodo, but since that union is conceived as an 'abstract' class, and in real-life all resources referenced by this property will also be DataObjects, than this shouldn't cause too much of a problem. Note that RFC allows ONLY UTC time values for this property." <http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/2007/04/02/ncal> .
