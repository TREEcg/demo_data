<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#versionInfo> "In 1.8, all object properties have been aligned to associatedWith, and some comments have been added.\nIn 1.7, the encodes object property has been modified in order to support any kind of information entity (purely social object or realization), and to give justice to computer science pragmatic equivalence between information objects that are fully encoded for computing, and the actual bits travelling in a machine or network, based on that encoding. The realizes property has been consequenctly declared as a subproperty of encodes.\nAlso removed redundant owl:someValuesFrom axioms\nIn 1.6, broadened range of hasRepresentationLanguage\nIn 1.5, some fixes added wrt to new plugins (Roles.owl, CollectionsLite.owl).\nIn 1.4, all elements have got English labels. Added the class LinguisticAct, useful to relate Agent(s) when use information objects to express meaning with some CommunicativeFunction (from the theory by Jakobson). Moreover, the relation between formal patterns and information patterns have been enriched. Some bugs fixed." <http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/IOLite.owl> .
