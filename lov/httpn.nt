The PAV ontology does however not formally restrict this, to cater for more complex scenarios with multiple abstraction levels.\n\nSimilarly, it would normally be incorrect to indicate a pav:hasCurrentVersion from an older version; instead the current version would be found by finding the non-versioned resource that the particular resource is a version of, and then its current version.\n\nThis property is normally used in a functional way, although PAV does not formally restrict this."@en <http://purl.org/pav/> .
