<http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/ontology/om/om-lite> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An OWL representation of the Observation Schema described in clauses 7-8 of ISO 19156:2011 Geographic Information - Observations and Measurements. \r\nIn contrast to previous versions developed through SSN and in conjunction with ISO 19150-2, this ontology has minimal dependencies on existing ontologies, particularly those that trigger extended chains of imports. Stub classes are provided for time, geometry and measure (scaled number), which can be substituted at run-time by a suitable concrete representation of the concept. \r\nObservation Collection has been (re-)introduced, to support the common case where a collection is homogeneous in one or more properties (feature-of-interest, phenomenon-time, observed-property, units-of-measure, procedure). The value of the common property may be recorded against the collection instead of repetitively against every member.   \r\n\r\nIn this revision, the observation result is an Object Property, in order to conform to strict OWL2 semantics. The type constraints on Observation specializations TruthObservation and CountObservation have been changed, so that the range of oml:result is an Object containing the xsd type, rather than the data-type itself.
