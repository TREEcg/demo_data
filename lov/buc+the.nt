An object can play a certain role in some happenings. Objects could be substantially real - as the Buckingham Palace or a hardcopy book - or substantially imperceptible - for instance, an electronic document that exists only virtually, one cannot touch it."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .
