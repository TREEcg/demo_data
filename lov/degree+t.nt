The original painting of the Mona Lisa in the Louvre may be said to bear the same instance of E38 Image as reproductions in the form of transparencies, postcards, posters or T-shirts, even though they may differ in size and carrier and may vary in tone and colour. The images in a \"spot the difference\" competition are not the same with respect to their context, however similar they may at first appear.\n\nExamples:\n- the front side of all 20 Swiss Frs notes\n- the image depicted on all reproductions of the Mona Lisa\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE38(x) âŠƒ E36(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
