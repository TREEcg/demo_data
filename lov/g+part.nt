Since such reals can approximate any measure where absolute accuracy is not possible, this form of numeric is most often used for measures. In cases were absolute accuracy is needed, such as currencies, then a decimal representation may be preferred (assuming the currency is decimal, such as the US dollar, British pound, etc.). Where there are no subunits possible, Integer numbers may be preferred.  \n\nCan be thought of as an integer part followed by a fractional part given in multiples of powers of 1/2 (halves)." <http://def.seegrid.csiro.au/isotc211/iso19103/2005/basic> .

It differs from the common binary Real implementation in that it can represent 1/10 (one-tenth) without error, while binary real representation can only represent powers of 1/2 (one-half) exactly. Since many currencies are decimal, these representations are preferred in dealing with such moneys.
