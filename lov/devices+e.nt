In that case,the issuer is the passive victim of the attack.\nAlmost all electrical devices emit radiation to the exterior that can be intercepted by other equipment (radio receivers) causing a leak of information. This threat is frequently but inaccurately called, a TEMPEST attack (“Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Standard”)." <http://www.semanticweb.org/ontologies/2008/11/OntologySecurity.owl> .
