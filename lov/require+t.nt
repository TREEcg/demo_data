<http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop#hasDate> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Typically, Date will be associated with the creation or availability of the resource. Recommended best practice for encoding the date value is defined in a profile of ISO 8601 [W3CDTF] and includes (among others) dates of the form YYYY-MM-DD. For official documents, it could be the date of signature. It can also contain a java timestamp. Usually, time is connected to a happening (event/situation) in which the information resource is a participation entity. These include: creation of the information resource, its modification or other important happening. Very often such happening is in the background knowledge and the modeling of domain task does not require the explicit representation of this happening. If it plays important role in the model domain or for the task, then the user needs to extend the ontology in an appropriate way."@en <http://www.ontotext.com/proton/protontop> .

This class does not require this interpretation, it is merely enough that the annotation body mentions the annotated resource, for instance to give it a dc:title or to relate two annotated resources.  Also note that the next version of the AO ontology (v2) might change this definition of ao:hasTopic, removing the need for this class."@en <http://purl.org/wf4ever/ro> .

It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances it may describe:\n1. the beginning of custody\n2. the end of custody\n3. the transfer of custody\n4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source\n5. the declared loss of an object\n\nThe distinction between the legal responsibility for custody and the actual physical possession of the object should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). A specific case of transfer of custody is theft. The sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody is in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing. For instance, in the case of a set of cutlery we may require the majority of pieces having been in the hands of the actor regardless which individual pieces are kept over time. \n\nThe interpretation of the museum notion of \"accession\" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.\n\nExamples:\n- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery\n- the return of Picasso's \"Guernica\" to Madrid's Prado in 1981\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE10(x) ⊃ E7(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
