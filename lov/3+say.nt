It links a profile field to a value. Thus, on an accommodation level, it might link the number of rooms with a shower, to an integer value, to indicated that an accommodation has (say) 39 rooms with a shower. On a unit level, it might indicate that a room is wheelchair-accessible. Lists of profile values are available, at the accommodation and unit level, in Appendix A." <https://opendata.aragon.es/def/ei2a/ei2a.owl> .
