ISO defines them in three separate standards. However, their interaction has been poorly studied, so far. The SQuAP model (Software Quality, Architecture, Process) describes twenty-eight main factors that impact on software quality in banking systems, and each factor is described as a relation among some characteristics from the three ISO standards. Hence, SQuAP makes such relations emerge rigorously, although informally. SQaAP-Ont is an OWL ontology that formalises those relations in order to represent and reason via Linked Data about software engineering in a three-dimensional model consisting of quality, architecture, and process characteristics." <https://w3id.org/squap/> .
