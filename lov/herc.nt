<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E5_Event> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises changes of states in cultural, social or physical systems, regardless of scale, brought about by a series or group of coherent physical, cultural, technological or legal phenomena. Such changes of state will affect instances of E77 Persistent Item or its subclasses.\n\nThe distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is partly a question of the scale of observation. Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an 'instantaneous' change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy change of state.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Cleopatra (E67)\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6)\n- World War II (E7)\n- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7)\n- the Yalta Conference (E7)\n- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)\n- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday\n- the CIDOC Conference 2003 (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE5(x) ⊃ E4(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .

<http://erlangen-crm.org/current/E6_Destruction> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Scope note:\nThis class comprises events that destroy one or more instances of E18 Physical Thing such that they lose their identity as the subjects of documentation.\n\nSome destruction events are intentional, while others are independent of human activity. Intentional destruction may be documented by classifying the event as both an E6 Destruction and E7 Activity.\n\nThe decision to document an object as destroyed, transformed or modified is context sensitive:\n1.  If the matter remaining from the destruction is not documented, the event is modelled solely as E6 Destruction.\n2. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the original. In this case, the new items have separate identities. Matter is preserved, but identity is not.\n3. When the initial identity of the changed instance of E18 Physical Thing is preserved, the event should be documented as E11 Modification.\n\nExamples:\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD\n- the destruction of Nineveh (E6, E7)\n- the breaking of a champagne glass yesterday by my dog\n\nIn First Order Logic:\nE6(x) ⊃ E64(x)"@en <http://erlangen-crm.org/current/> .
