<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Role> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Role provides the pattern for the role fillers in a frame instantiation, that\n            occurs in SituationSchema, for describing processes and states. A Role is filled by a\n            DramaEntity: the fact that a given role has an entity as a filler is represented by the\n            hasFiller property and its inverse isFillerOf property. A Role belongs (isRoleOf) to a\n            given SituationSchema, namely a ProcessSchema or a StateSchema (hasRole property). The\n            Role class is related to its filler by the hasFiller property, whose range is the\n            DramaEntity class. For example, given the incident describable as \"Ophelia gives\n            the gift back to Hamlet\", the roles of \"donor\" (the one who does the\n            action of giving), \"recipient\" (the one wjho receives the object to be given)\n            and \"theme\" (the object of giving action) are all instance of the Role class\n            connected to the same Situation, each labeled with a linguistic label\n            (\"donor\", \"recipient\", etc.) and each connected to its filler via\n            the hasFiller property. Roles can also be intended as thematic roles of verbs following\n            the description contained in the Verbnet resource\n            (http://verbs.colorado.edu/verb-index/index.php). The Role class, via the hasExtRef\n            object property, is linked to the subclass of the top level ExternalReference class, the\n            ExternalRefRole class, whose function is to connect the description of the role with the\n            appropriate role name or URI in a linguistic account of roles through apposite data\n            properties (namely, the Role_framenetRoleID and Role_verbnetRoleType data properties\n            respectively for FrameNet and VerbNet)." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
