<http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/postcode/PositionalQualityIndicator> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "The importance of checking the Positional Quality Indicator (PQI), to establish Code-Point Open location coordinate (CPLC) positional quality, cannot be overemphasised.\n\nIt indicates the positional accuracy of the Code-Point Open coordinates. There are seven PQI values for the positional quality of CPLCs. The order shown indicates the level of quality associated with the PQI; PQ10 is the most accurate and PQ90 the least. The PQI assigned to the CPLC will depend on the coordinates available in ADDRESS-POINT to generate the CPLC. If the ADDRESS-POINT PQI is PQ3, the best it can be, then the Code-Point Open PQI will be PQ10." <http://data.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/ontology/postcode/> .
