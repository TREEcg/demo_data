In SKOS, all documentation notes are associated with concepts.\n\nIn basic SKOS, notes are represented using simple annotation properties, which type captures the note type. However the SKOS annotation properties can also be used with structured representation of notes as fully-fledged resources. See http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secdocumentation and http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/#secadvanceddocumentation for examples of both approaches.\n\nWithin a thesaurus the application of notes to concept and term is more restrictive than in SKOS.\n\nA note may have some structure or formatting. In general, this can be modelled using rdf:value (to represent lexicalValue)\n\nThe language should be held in rdf:value. If this is an XMLLiteral, the language shall also be made available using dc:language (or dct:language).\n\nNote: Work is ongoing in the RDF group to type the content explicitly as HTML or XML In RDF1.1 (http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/rdf/raw-file/default/rdf-concepts/index.html#section-html).
