<http://spinrdf.org/spin#TableDataProvider> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "An abstraction of objects that can produce tabular data. This serves as a base class of spin:SelectTemplate, because SELECT queries can produce tables with columns for each result variable. However, other types of TableDataProviders are conceivable by other frameworks, and this class may prove as a useful shared foundation.\n\nTableDataProviders can link to definitions of columns via spin:column, and these definitions can inform rendering engines." <http://spinrdf.org/spin> .

To separate this distinction with relation to the data subject, the Consent class represents the consent of the data subject in its entirely, including any history and annotations for it.\n\nTo link the `Consent` instance with the `DataSubject` instance, use the `isConsentForDataSubject` and `hasConsent` properties."@en <https://w3id.org/GConsent> .
