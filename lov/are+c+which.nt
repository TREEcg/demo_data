<http://caressesrobot.org/ontology> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "As part of a joint effort towards the development of a culturally competent robot for elderly care, experts in Transcultural Nursing have led the development of guidelines defining the behaviour and functionalities of a culturally competent robot for older people, linking cultural knowledge and perceptual information to actions and utterances. These guidelines have an impact upon the following main areas:\n\n- Goals. The user always has the last word in choosing what the robot should do for her. However, the robot might proactively make suggestions, and some of them might depend on cultural factors. What activity should the robot suggest the user to engage in before lunch? Cooking - and what menu?, praying - and how? What will the user most likely want to be reminded of? Social or cultural events - and which ones? TV shows?\n- Actions and their parameters. Different cultures may use different actions to convey the same concept. How should the robot greet the user? Waving, bowing, or with a Namaste? What volume would the user be comfortable with? What distance while interacting? \n- Norms. Behaviours which are common in one culture might be unacceptable in others. Are there areas of the house that should be off-limits for the robot? Does the answer depend on the time of the day? What is the user likely to consider as private?\n- Topics of conversation.  Different cultures might have different histories, customs and traditions, which influence the lifestyle of people. What are the topics a user might like to talk about? Is she interested in sports, movies, politics or social activities? And if so, which sports, which types of movies could the robot suggest? Topics of conversation are also those activities in which the robot might assist the user, independently from any physical assistance it might also provide. Could the user be interested in discussing pizza toppings? Could this motivate her to bake a pizza herself? Or to call her friends for an evening out?\n\nThe CARESSES Ontology encodes all these guidelines, with the aim of offering a specific tool for endowing robots with cultural competence. In particular, this Ontology may be used to:\n\n- provide suitable Goals, Operators, Actions and Parameters to the planner\n- handle the verbal interaction between the robot and the user, in a cultural competent way.\n- store user-specific information, that makes the robot attune its behaviour towards the assisted person’s preferences and needs.\n\nPlease refer to the following for additional information:\n- http://caressesrobot.org, CARESSES project website;\n- Bruno, B., Menicatti, R., Recchiuto, C.

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#Process> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Processes represents the dynamic class of the perdurants: they are gathered\n            into units, which are contained into ordered timelines bordered by states. Process is\n            the class that bridges to the concept of Process in upper ontologies, externally to\n            Drammar (like DOLCE, where States and Processes are types of Statives: here, we include\n            also the event types called accomplishments and achievements in DOLCE). Consider that\n            such resources are not of linguistic type. The DescriptionTemplate class (or, better,\n            its subclass FrameNetSchema), in fact, drives the behavior of the process inside a Plan\n            or a Unit, linking it (via the ExternalReference Class) to: 1. a Wordnet sense 2. a\n            Frame (from Framenet or Verbnet) 3. a set of Roles, played by roles encompassed in the\n            frame All these links are bridged by the ExternalReference Class, which has\n            \"quale\" properties that link the reference to specific resources. In the\n            external ontology, a process may be logically defined through the use of axioms: for\n            example, in the action of asking, it is assumed that Speaker and Addressee are connected\n            through some communication medium, e.g. co-presence in a room or a telephone. In\n            Drammar, the DramaStructures that contain the Processes are Units (subclasses of\n            DramaSets) and Plans (subclasses of DramaLists). They are then subdivided through a\n            further trait, that is whether the process is intentional (of an agent) or not (Action\n            or UnintentionalProcess). This trait is defined through a specific Datatype property, of\n            boolean type, called isIntentional. So, its subclasses are: - Action: with isIntentional\n            property valued TRUE; - UnintentionalProcess: with isIntentional property valued FALSE.\n            Same happens in parallel to the States, although in that case the trait concerns the\n            state schema." <http://www.purl.org/drammar> .
