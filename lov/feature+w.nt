<http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl#BindingFeature> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "Definition : An entity feature that represent the bound state of a physical entity. A pair of binding features represents a bond. \n\nRationale: A physical entity in a molecular complex is considered as a new state of an entity as it is structurally and functionally different. Binding features provide facilities for describing these states. Similar to other features, a molecule can have bound and not-bound states. \n\nUsage: Typically, binding features are present in pairs, each describing the binding characteristic for one of the interacting physical entities. One exception is using a binding feature with no paired feature to describe any potential binding. For example, an unbound receptor can be described by using a \"not-feature\" property with an unpaired binding feature as its value.  BindingSiteType and featureLocation allows annotating the binding location.\n\nIntraMolecular property should be set to \"true\" if the bond links two parts of the same molecule. A pair of binding features are still used where they are owned by the same physical entity. \n\nIf the binding is due to the covalent interactions, for example in the case of lipoproteins, CovalentBindingFeature subclass should be used instead of this class." <http://www.biopax.org/release/biopax-level3.owl> .

Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.\n\nThis classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes.

<http://www.purl.org/drammar#DramaEndurant> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "DramaEndurant is an entity of drama that can be described as an endurant\n            following Gangemi et al. 2002. In Gangemi et al. 2002 \"Endurants are wholly present\n            (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present\",\n            differently from perdurants, which are only partially present at any time they are\n            present. Endurants (and Perdurants, in some cases) play a role in processes and states:\n            an Endurant is connected to a role (Role class) in the description of a given process or\n            state by the hasRole object property. The class of drama endurants encompasses more\n            specific drama entities such as Agent and Object. This bipartite distinction is derived\n            from the drama literature, where - Agents that intentionally perform actions; - Objects\n            are involved in the actions in an unintentional way. For instance, in Hamlet, the King\n            of England is a drama endurant (but non an agent) because it is the filler of a role in\n            Claudius' actions (sending ... ) but does not intend any plan (a feature would\n            locate it in the Agent class). The difference beteween the King of England and a coffee\n            machine is entrusted to common sense knowlegde (e.g., the external lexical knowledge\n            stating the sementic type of these two entities).

The characteristics of the samples themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.\n\nA Sample is intended to sample some FatureOfInterest, so there is an expectation of at least one isSampleOf property. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features."@en <http://www.w3id.org/def/caso#> .
